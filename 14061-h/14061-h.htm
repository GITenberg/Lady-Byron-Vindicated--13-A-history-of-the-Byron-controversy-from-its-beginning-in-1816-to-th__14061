<h1>LADY BYRON VINDICATED<br />
BY HARRIET BEECHER STOWE.</h1>
<p>A history of the Byron Controversy from its beginning in 1816 to
the present time.</p>
<h2>NOTE BY THE PUBLISHERS.</h2>
<p>The subject of this volume is of such painful notoriety that any
apology from the Publishers may seem unnecessary upon issuing the Author&rsquo;s
reply to the counter statements which her narrative in <i>Macmillan&rsquo;s
Magazine</i> has called forth.&nbsp; Nevertheless they consider it right
to state that their strong regard for the Author, respect for her motives,
and assurance of her truthfulness, would, even in the absence of all
other considerations, be sufficient to induce them to place their imprint
on the title-page.</p>
<p>The publication has been undertaken by them at the Author&rsquo;s
request, &lsquo;as her friends,&rsquo; and as the publishers of her
former works, and from a feeling that whatever difference of opinion
may be entertained respecting the Author&rsquo;s judiciousness in publishing
&lsquo;The True Story,&rsquo; she is entitled to defend it, having been
treated with grave injustice, and often with much maliciousness, by
her critics and opponents, and been charged with motives from which
no person living is more free.&nbsp; An intense love of justice and
hatred of oppression, with an utter disregard of her own interests,
characterise Mrs. Stowe&rsquo;s conduct and writings, as all who know
her well will testify; and the Publishers can unhesitatingly affirm
their belief that neither fear for loss of her literary fame, nor hope
of gain, has for one moment influenced her in the course she has taken.</p>

<h2>PART I.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I.&nbsp; INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<p>The interval since my publication of &lsquo;The True Story of Lady
Byron&rsquo;s Life&rsquo; has been one of stormy discussion and of much
invective.</p>
<p>I have not thought it necessary to disturb my spirit and confuse
my sense of right by even an attempt at reading the many abusive articles
that both here and in England have followed that disclosure.&nbsp; Friends
have undertaken the task for me, giving me from time to time the substance
of anything really worthy of attention which came to view in the tumult.</p>
<p>It appeared to me essential that this first excitement should in
a measure spend itself before there would be a possibility of speaking
to any purpose.&nbsp; Now, when all would seem to have spoken who can
speak, and, it is to be hoped, have said the utmost they can say, there
seems a propriety in listening calmly, if that be possible, to what
I have to say in reply.</p>
<p>And, first, why have I made this disclosure at all?</p>
<p><i>To this I answer briefly, Because I considered it my duty to make
it.</i></p>
<p>I made it in defence of a beloved, revered friend, whose memory stood
forth in the eyes of the civilised world charged with most repulsive
crimes, of which I <i>certainly</i> knew her innocent.</p>
<p>I claim, and shall prove, that Lady Byron&rsquo;s reputation has
been the victim of a concerted attack, begun by her husband during her
lifetime, and coming to its climax over her grave.&nbsp; I claim, and
shall prove, that it was not I who stirred up this controversy in this
year 1869.&nbsp; I shall show <i>who did do it</i>, and who is responsible
for bringing on me that hard duty of making these disclosures, which
it appears to me ought to have been made by others.</p>
<p>I claim that these facts were given to me unguarded by any promise
or seal of secrecy, expressed or implied; that they were lodged with
me as one sister rests her story with another for sympathy, for counsel,
for defence.&nbsp; <i>Never</i> did I suppose the day would come that
I should be subjected to so cruel an anguish as this use of them has
been to me.&nbsp; Never did I suppose that,&mdash;when those kind hands,
that had shed nothing but blessings, were lying in the helplessness
of death, when that gentle heart, so sorely tried and to the last so
full of love, was lying cold in the tomb,&mdash;a countryman in England
could be found to cast the foulest slanders on her grave, and not one
in all England to raise an effective voice in her defence.</p>
<p>I admit the feebleness of my plea, in point of execution.&nbsp; It
was written in a state of exhausted health, when no labour of the kind
was safe for me,&mdash;when my hand had not strength to hold the pen,
and I was forced to dictate to another.</p>
<p>I have been told that I have no reason to congratulate myself on
it as a literary effort.&nbsp; O my brothers and sisters! is there then
nothing in the world to think of but literary efforts?&nbsp; I ask any
man with a heart in his bosom, if he had been obliged to tell a story
so cruel, because his mother&rsquo;s grave gave no rest from slander,&mdash;I
ask any woman who had been forced to such a disclosure to free a dead
sister&rsquo;s name from grossest insults, whether she would have thought
of making this work of bitterness a literary success?</p>
<p>Are the cries of the oppressed, the gasps of the dying, the last
prayers of mothers,&mdash;are <i>any</i> words wrung like drops of blood
from the human heart to be judged as literary efforts?</p>
<p>My fellow-countrymen of America, men of the press, I have done you
one act of justice,&mdash;of all your bitter articles, I have read not
one.&nbsp; I shall never be troubled in the future time by the remembrance
of any unkind word you have said of me, for at this moment I recollect
not one.&nbsp; I had such faith in you, such pride in my countrymen,
as men with whom, above all others, the cause of woman was safe and
sacred, that I was at first astonished and incredulous at what I heard
of the course of the American press, and was silent, not merely from
the impossibility of being heard, but from grief and shame.&nbsp; But
reflection convinces me that you were, in many cases, acting from a
misunderstanding of facts and through misguided honourable feeling;
and I still feel courage, therefore, to ask from you a fair hearing.&nbsp;
Now, as I have done you this justice, will you also do me the justice
to hear me seriously and candidly?</p>
<p>What interest have you or I, my brother and my sister, in this short
life of ours, to utter anything but the truth?&nbsp; Is not truth between
man and man and between man and woman the foundation on which all things
rest?&nbsp; Have you not, every individual of you, who must hereafter
give an account yourself alone to God, an interest to know the exact
truth in this matter, and a duty to perform as respects that truth?&nbsp;
Hear me, then, while I tell you the position in which I stood, and what
was my course in relation to it.</p>
<p>A shameless attack on my friend&rsquo;s memory had appeared in the
&lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; of July 1869, branding Lady Byron as the vilest
of criminals, and recommending the Guiccioli book to a Christian public
as interesting from the very fact that it was the avowed production
of Lord Byron&rsquo;s mistress.&nbsp; No efficient protest was made
against this outrage in England, and Littell&rsquo;s &lsquo;Living Age&rsquo;
reprinted the &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; article, and the Harpers, the
largest publishing house in America, perhaps in the world, re-published
the book.</p>
<p>Its statements&mdash;with those of the &lsquo;Blackwood,&rsquo; &lsquo;Pall
Mall Gazette,&rsquo; and other English periodicals&mdash;were being
propagated through all the young reading and writing world of America.&nbsp;
I was meeting them advertised in dailies, and made up into articles
in magazines, and thus the generation of to-day, who had no means of
judging Lady Byron but by these fables of her slanderers, were being
foully deceived.&nbsp; The friends who knew her personally were a small
select circle in England, whom death is every day reducing.&nbsp; They
were few in number compared with the great world, and were <i>silent</i>.&nbsp;
I saw these foul slanders crystallising into history uncontradicted
by friends who knew her personally, who, firm in their own knowledge
of her virtues and limited in view as aristocratic circles generally
are, had no idea of the width of the world they were living in, and
the exigency of the crisis.&nbsp; When time passed on and no voice was
raised, I spoke.&nbsp; I gave at first a simple story, for I knew instinctively
that whoever put the first steel point of truth into this dark cloud
of slander must wait for the storm to spend itself.&nbsp; I must say
the storm exceeded my expectations, and has raged loud and long.&nbsp;
But now that there is a comparative stillness I shall proceed, first,
to prove what I have just been asserting, and, second, to add to my
true story such facts and incidents as I did not think proper at first
to state.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.&nbsp; THE ATTACK ON LADY BYRON.</h3>
<p>In proving what I asserted in the first chapter, I make four points:</p>
<p>1st.&nbsp; A concerted attack upon Lady Byron&rsquo;s reputation,
begun by Lord Byron in self-defence.</p>
<p>2nd.&nbsp; That he transmitted his story to friends to be continued
after his death.</p>
<p>3rd.&nbsp; That they did so continue it.</p>
<p>4th.&nbsp; That the accusations reached their climax over Lady Byron&rsquo;s
grave in &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; of 1869, and the Guiccioli book, and
that this re-opening of the controversy was my reason for speaking.</p>
<p>And first I shall adduce my proofs that Lady Byron&rsquo;s reputation
was, during the whole course of her husband&rsquo;s life, the subject
of a concentrated, artfully planned attack, commencing at the time of
the separation and continuing during his life.&nbsp; By various documents
carefully prepared, and used publicly or secretly as suited the case,
he made converts of many honest men, some of whom were writers and men
of letters, who put their talents at his service during his lifetime
in exciting sympathy for him, and who, by his own request, felt bound
to continue their defence of him after he was dead.</p>
<p>In order to consider the force and significance of the documents
I shall cite, we are to bring to our view just the issues Lord Byron
had to meet, both at the time of the separation and for a long time
after.</p>
<p>In Byron&rsquo;s &lsquo;Memoirs,&rsquo; Vol. IV. Letter 350, under
date December 10, 1819, nearly four years after the separation, he writes
to Murray in a state of great excitement on account of an article in
&lsquo;Blackwood,&rsquo; in which his conduct towards his wife had been
sternly and justly commented on, and which he supposed to have been
written by Wilson, of the &lsquo;Noctes Ambrosianae.&rsquo;&nbsp; He
says in this letter: &lsquo;I like and admire W---n, and he should not
have indulged himself in such outrageous license. . . . .&nbsp; When
he talks of Lady Byron&rsquo;s business he talks of what he knows nothing
about; and you may tell him <i>no man can desire a public investigation
of that affair more than I do</i>.&rsquo; <a name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7">{7}</a></p>
<p>He shortly after wrote and sent to Murray a pamphlet for publication,
which was printed, but not generally circulated till some time afterwards.&nbsp;
Though more than three years had elapsed since the separation, the current
against him at this time was so strong in England that his friends thought
it best, at first, to use this article of Lord Byron&rsquo;s discreetly
with influential persons rather than to give it to the public.</p>
<p>The writer in &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; and the indignation of the
English public, of which that writer was the voice, were now particularly
stirred up by the appearance of the first two cantos of &lsquo;Don Juan,&rsquo;
in which the indecent caricature of Lady Byron was placed in vicinity
with other indecencies, the publication of which was justly considered
an insult to a Christian community.</p>
<p>It must here be mentioned, for the honour of Old England, that at
first she did her duty quite respectably in regard to &lsquo;Don Juan.&rsquo;&nbsp;
One can still read, in Murray&rsquo;s standard edition of the poems,
how every respectable press thundered reprobations, which it would be
well enough to print and circulate as tracts for our days.</p>
<p>Byron, it seems, had thought of returning to England, but he says,
in the letter we have quoted, that he has changed his mind, and shall
not go back, adding &lsquo;I have finished the Third Canto of &ldquo;Don
Juan,&rdquo; but the things I have heard and read discourage all future
publication.&nbsp; You may try the copy question, but you&rsquo;ll lose
it; the cry is up, and the cant is up.&nbsp; I should have no objection
to return the price of the copyright, and have written to Mr. Kinnaird
on this subject.&rsquo;</p>
<p>One sentence quoted by Lord Byron from the &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo;
article will show the modern readers what the respectable world of that
day were thinking and saying of him:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;It appears, in short, as if this miserable man,
having exhausted every species of sensual gratification&mdash;having
drained the cup of sin even to its bitterest dregs&mdash;were resolved
to show us that he is no longer a human being even in his frailties,
but a cool, unconcerned fiend, laughing with detestable glee over the
whole of the better and worse elements of which human life is composed.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The defence which Lord Byron makes, in his reply to that paper, is
of a man cornered and fighting for his life.&nbsp; He speaks thus of
the state of feeling at the time of his separation from his wife:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I was accused of every monstrous vice by public
rumour and private rancour; my name, which had been a knightly or a
noble one since my fathers helped to conquer the kingdom for William
the Norman, was tainted.&nbsp; I felt that, if what was whispered and
muttered and murmured was true, I was unfit for England; if false, England
was unfit for me.&nbsp; I withdrew; but this was not enough.&nbsp; In
other countries&mdash;in Switzerland, in the shadow of the Alps, and
by the blue depth of the lakes&mdash;I was pursued and breathed upon
by the same blight.&nbsp; I crossed the mountains, but it was the same;
so I went a little farther, and settled myself by the waves of the Adriatic,
like the stag at bay, who betakes him to the waters.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I may judge by the statements of the few friends who gathered
round me, the outcry of the period to which I allude was beyond all
precedent, all parallel, even in those cases where political motives
have sharpened slander and doubled enmity.&nbsp; I was advised not to
go to the theatres lest I should be hissed, nor to my duty in parliament
lest I should be insulted by the way; even on the day of my departure
my most intimate friend told me afterwards that he was under the apprehension
of violence from the people who might be assembled at the door of the
carriage.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now Lord Byron&rsquo;s charge against his wife was that SHE was directly
responsible for getting up and keeping up this persecution, which drove
him from England,&mdash;that she did it in a deceitful, treacherous
manner, which left him no chance of defending himself.</p>
<p>He charged against her that, taking advantage of a time when his
affairs were in confusion, and an execution in the house, she left him
suddenly, with treacherous professions of kindness, which were repeated
by letters on the road, and that soon after her arrival at her home
her parents sent him word that she would never return to him, and she
confirmed the message; that when he asked the reason why, she refused
to state any; and that when this step gave rise to a host of slanders
against him she silently encouraged and confirmed the slanders.&nbsp;
His claim was that he was denied from that time forth even the justice
of any tangible accusation against himself which he might meet and refute.</p>
<p>He observes, in the same article from which we have quoted:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;When one tells me that I cannot &ldquo;in any
way justify my own behaviour in that affair,&rdquo; I acquiesce, because
no man can &ldquo;justify&rdquo; himself until he knows of what he is
accused; and I have never had&mdash;and, God knows, my whole desire
has ever been to obtain it&mdash;any specific charge, in a tangible
shape, submitted to me by the adversary, nor by others, unless the atrocities
of public rumour and the mysterious silence of the lady&rsquo;s legal
advisers may be deemed such.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lord Byron, his publishers, friends, and biographers, thus agree
in representing his wife as the secret author and abettor of that persecution,
which it is claimed broke up his life, and was the source of all his
subsequent crimes and excesses.</p>
<p>Lord Byron wrote a poem in September 1816, in Switzerland, just after
the separation, in which he stated, in so many words, these accusations
against his wife.&nbsp; Shortly after the poet&rsquo;s death Murray
published this poem, together with the &lsquo;Fare thee well,&rsquo;
and the lines to his sister, under the title of &lsquo;Domestic Pieces,&rsquo;
in his standard edition of Byron&rsquo;s poetry.&nbsp; It is to be remarked,
then, that this was for some time a private document, shown to confidential
friends, and made use of judiciously, as readers or listeners to his
story were able to bear it.&nbsp; Lady Byron then had a strong party
in England.&nbsp; Sir Samuel Romilly and Dr. Lushington were her counsel.&nbsp;
Lady Byron&rsquo;s parents were living, and the appearance in the public
prints of such a piece as this would have brought down an aggravated
storm of public indignation.</p>
<p>For the general public such documents as the &lsquo;Fare thee well&rsquo;
were circulating in England, and he frankly confessed his wife&rsquo;s
virtues and his own sins to Madame de Sta&euml;l and others in Switzerland,
declaring himself in the wrong, sensible of his errors, and longing
to cast himself at the feet of that serene perfection,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Which wanted one sweet weakness&mdash;to forgive.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But a little later he drew for his private partisans this bitter
poetical indictment against her, which, as we have said, was used discreetly
during his life, and published after his death.</p>
<p>Before we proceed to lay that poem before the reader we will refresh
his memory with some particulars of the tragedy of &AElig;schylus, which
Lord Byron selected as the exact parallel and proper illustration of
his wife&rsquo;s treatment of himself.&nbsp; In his letters and journals
he often alludes to her as Clytemnestra, and the allusion has run the
round of a thousand American papers lately, and been read by a thousand
good honest people, who had no very clear idea who Clytemnestra was,
and what she did which was like the proceedings of Lady Byron.&nbsp;
According to the tragedy, Clytemnestra secretly hates her husband Agamemnon,
whom she professes to love, and wishes to put him out of the way that
she may marry her lover, &AElig;gistheus.&nbsp; When her husband returns
from the Trojan war she receives him with pretended kindness, and officiously
offers to serve him at the bath.&nbsp; Inducing him to put on a garment,
of which she had adroitly sewed up the sleeves and neck so as to hamper
the use of his arms, she gives the signal to a concealed band of assassins,
who rush upon him and stab him.&nbsp; Clytemnestra is represented by
&AElig;schylus as grimly triumphing in her success, which leaves her
free to marry an adulterous paramour.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I did it, too, in such a cunning wise,<br />
That he could neither &rsquo;scape nor ward off doom.<br />
I staked around his steps an endless net,<br />
As for the fishes.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the piece entitled &lsquo;Lines on hearing Lady Byron is ill,&rsquo;
Lord Byron charges on his wife a similar treachery and cruelty.&nbsp;
The whole poem is in Murray&rsquo;s English edition, Vol. IV. p. 207.&nbsp;
Of it we quote the following.&nbsp; The reader will bear in mind that
it is addressed to Lady Byron on a sick-bed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I am too well avenged, but &rsquo;t was my right;<br />
Whate&rsquo;er my sins might be, thou wert not sent<br />
To be the Nemesis that should requite,<br />
Nor did Heaven choose so near an instrument.<br />
Mercy is for the merciful!&nbsp; If thou<br />
Hast been of such, &rsquo;t will be accorded now.<br />
Thy nights are banished from the realms of sleep,<br />
For thou art pillowed on a curse too deep;<br />
Yes! they may flatter thee, but thou shalt feel<br />
A hollow agony that will not heal.<br />
Thou hast sown in my sorrow, and must reap<br />
The bitter harvest in a woe as real.<br />
I have had many foes, but none like thee;<br />
For &rsquo;gainst the rest myself I could defend,<br />
And be avenged, or turn them into friend;<br />
But thou, in safe implacability,<br />
Hast naught to dread,&mdash;in thy own weakness shielded,<br />
And in my love, which hath but too much yielded,<br />
And spared, for thy sake, some I should not spare.<br />
And thus upon the world, trust in thy truth,<br />
And the wild fame of my ungoverned youth,&mdash;<br />
On things that were not and on things that are,&mdash;<br />
Even upon such a basis thou halt built<br />
A monument whose cement hath been guilt!<br />
The moral Clytemnestra of thy lord,<br />
And hewed down with an unsuspected sword<br />
Fame, peace, and hope, and all that better life<br />
Which, but for this cold treason of thy heart,<br />
Might yet have risen from the grave of strife<br />
And found a nobler duty than to part.<br />
But of thy virtues thou didst make a vice,<br />
Trafficking in them with a purpose cold,<br />
And buying others&rsquo; woes at any price,<br />
For present anger and for future gold;<br />
And thus, once entered into crooked ways,<br />
The early truth, that was thy proper praise,<br />
Did not still walk beside thee, but at times,<br />
And with a breast unknowing its own crimes,<br />
Deceits, averments incompatible,<br />
Equivocations, and the thoughts that dwell<br />
In Janus spirits, the significant eye<br />
That learns to lie with silence, <a name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14">{14}</a>
the pretext<br />
Of prudence with advantages annexed,<br />
The acquiescence in all things that tend,<br />
No matter how, to the desired end,&mdash;<br />
All found a place in thy philosophy.<br />
The means were worthy and the end is won.<br />
I would not do to thee as thou hast done.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, if this language means anything, it means, in plain terms, that,
whereas, in her early days, Lady Byron was peculiarly characterised
by truthfulness, she has in her recent dealings with him acted the part
of a liar,&mdash;that she is not only a liar, but that she lies for
cruel means and malignant purposes,&mdash;that she is a moral assassin,
and her treatment of her husband has been like that of the most detestable
murderess and adulteress of ancient history, that she has learned to
lie skilfully and artfully, that she equivocates, says incompatible
things, and crosses her own tracks,&mdash;that she is double-faced,
and has the art to lie even by silence, and that she has become wholly
unscrupulous, and acquiesces in <i>any</i>thing, no matter what, that
tends to the desired end, and that end the destruction of her husband.&nbsp;
This is a brief summary of the story that Byron made it his life&rsquo;s
business to spread through society, to propagate and make converts to
during his life, and which has been in substance reasserted by &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo;
in a recent article this year.</p>
<p>Now, the reader will please to notice that this poem is dated in
September 1816, and that on the 29th of March of that same year, he
had thought proper to tell quite another story.&nbsp; At that time the
deed of separation was not signed, and negotiations between Lady Byron,
acting by legal counsel, and himself were still pending.&nbsp; At that
time, therefore, he was standing in a community who knew all he had
said in former days of his wife&rsquo;s character, who were in an aroused
and excited state by the fact that so lovely and good and patient a
woman had actually been forced for some unexplained cause to leave him.&nbsp;
His policy at that time was to make large general confessions of sin,
and to praise and compliment her, with a view of enlisting sympathy.&nbsp;
Everybody feels for a handsome sinner, weeping on his knees, asking
pardon for his offences against his wife in the public newspapers.</p>
<p>The celebrated &lsquo;Fare thee well,&rsquo; as we are told, was
written on the 17th of March, and accidentally found its way into the
newspapers at this time &lsquo;through the imprudence of a friend whom
he allowed to take a copy.&rsquo;&nbsp; These &lsquo;imprudent friends&rsquo;
have all along been such a marvellous convenience to Lord Byron.</p>
<p>But the question met him on all sides, What is the matter?&nbsp;
This wife you have declared the brightest, sweetest, most amiable of
beings, and against whose behaviour as a wife you actually never had
nor can have a complaint to make,&mdash;why is she <i>now</i> all of
a sudden so inflexibly set against you?</p>
<p>This question required an answer, and he answered by writing another
poem, which also <i>accidentally</i> found its way into the public prints.&nbsp;
It is in his &lsquo;Domestic Pieces,&rsquo; which the reader may refer
to at the end of this volume, and is called &lsquo;A Sketch.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a most excellent, respectable, well-behaved Englishwoman,
a Mrs. Clermont, <a name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16">{16}</a>
who had been Lady Byron&rsquo;s governess in her youth, and was still,
in mature life, revered as her confidential friend.&nbsp; It appears
that this person had been with Lady Byron during a part of her married
life, especially the bitter hours of her lonely child-bed, when a young
wife so much needs a sympathetic friend.&nbsp; This Mrs. Clermont was
the person selected by Lord Byron at this time to be the scapegoat to
bear away the difficulties of the case into the wilderness.</p>
<p>We are informed in Moore&rsquo;s Life what a noble pride of rank
Lord Byron possessed, and how when the headmaster of a school, against
whom he had a pique, invited him to dinner, he declined, saying, &lsquo;To
tell you the truth, Doctor, if you should come to Newstead, I shouldn&rsquo;t
think of inviting <i>you</i> to dine with <i>me</i>, and so I don&rsquo;t
care to dine with you here.&rsquo;&nbsp; Different countries, it appears,
have different standards as to good taste; Moore gives this as an amusing
instance of a young lord&rsquo;s spirit.</p>
<p>Accordingly, his first attack against this &lsquo;lady,&rsquo; as
we Americans should call her, consists in gross statements concerning
her having been born poor and in an inferior rank.&nbsp; He begins by
stating that she was</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Born in the garret, in the kitchen bred,<br />
Promoted thence to deck her mistress&rsquo; head;<br />
Next&mdash;for some gracious service unexpressed<br />
And from its wages only to be guessed&mdash;<br />
Raised from the toilet to the table, where<br />
Her wondering betters wait behind her chair.<br />
With eye unmoved and forehead unabashed,<br />
She dines from off the plate she lately washed:<br />
Quick with the tale, and ready with the lie,<br />
The genial confidante and general spy,&mdash;<br />
Who could, ye gods! her next employment guess,&mdash;<br />
An only infant&rsquo;s earliest governess!<br />
What had she made the pupil of her art<br />
None knows; but that high soul secured the heart,<br />
And panted for the truth it could not hear<br />
With longing soul and undeluded ear!&rsquo; <a name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17">{17}</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poet here recognises as a singular trait in Lady Byron her peculiar
love of truth,&mdash;a trait which must have struck everyone that had
any knowledge of her through life.&nbsp; He goes on now to give what
he certainly knew to be the real character of Lady Byron:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Foiled was perversion by that youthful mind,<br />
Which flattery fooled not, baseness could not blind,<br />
Deceit infect not, nor contagion soil,<br />
Indulgence weaken, or example spoil,<br />
Nor mastered science tempt her to look down<br />
On humbler talent with a pitying frown,<br />
Nor genius swell, nor beauty render vain,<br />
Nor envy ruffle to retaliate pain.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are now informed that Mrs. Clermont, whom he afterwards says in
his letters was a spy of Lady Byron&rsquo;s mother, set herself to make
mischief between them.&nbsp; He says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;If early habits,&mdash;those strong links that
bind<br />
 At times the loftiest to the meanest mind,<br />
 Have given her power too deeply to instil<br />
 The angry essence of her deadly will;<br />
 If like a snake she steal within your walls,<br />
 Till the black slime betray her as she crawls;<br />
 If like a viper to the heart she wind,<br />
 And leaves the venom there she did not find,&mdash;<br />
 What marvel that this hag of hatred works<br />
 Eternal evil latent as she lurks.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The noble lord then proceeds to abuse this woman of inferior rank
in the language of the upper circles.&nbsp; He thus describes her person
and manner:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Skilled by a touch to deepen scandal&rsquo;s tints<br />
 With all the kind mendacity of hints,<br />
 While mingling truth with falsehood, sneers with smiles,<br />
 A thread of candour with a web of wiles;<br />
 A plain blunt show of briefly-spoken seeming,<br />
 To hide her bloodless heart&rsquo;s soul-harden&rsquo;d scheming;<br />
 A lip of lies; a face formed to conceal,<br />
 And without feeling mock at all who feel;<br />
 With a vile mask the Gorgon would disown,&mdash;<br />
 A cheek of parchment and an eye of stone.<br />
 Mark how the channels of her yellow blood<br />
 Ooze to her skin and stagnate there to mud,<br />
 Cased like the centipede in saffron mail,<br />
 Or darker greenness of the scorpion&rsquo;s scale,&mdash;<br />
 (For drawn from reptiles only may we trace<br />
 Congenial colours in that soul or face,)<br />
 Look on her features! and behold her mind<br />
 As in a mirror of itself defined:<br />
 Look on the picture! deem it not o&rsquo;ercharged<br />
 There is no trait which might not be enlarged.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poem thus ends:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;May the strong curse of crushed affections light<br />
Back on thy bosom with reflected blight,<br />
And make thee in thy leprosy of mind<br />
As loathsome to thyself as to mankind!<br />
Till all thy self-thoughts curdle into hate,<br />
Black&mdash;as thy will for others would create;<br />
Till thy hard heart be calcined into dust,<br />
And thy soul welter in its hideous crust.<br />
O, may thy grave be sleepless as the bed,<br />
The widowed couch of fire, that thou hast spread<br />
Then when thou fain wouldst weary Heaven with prayer,<br />
Look on thy earthly victims&mdash;and despair!<br />
Down to the dust! and as thou rott&rsquo;st away,<br />
Even worms shall perish on thy poisonous clay.<br />
But for the love I bore and still must bear<br />
To her thy malice from all ties would tear,<br />
Thy name,&mdash;thy human name,&mdash;to every eye<br />
The climax of all scorn, should hang on high,<br />
Exalted o&rsquo;er thy less abhorred compeers,<br />
And festering in the infamy of years.&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; March 16, 1816.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, on the 29th of March 1816, this was Lord Byron&rsquo;s story.&nbsp;
He states that his wife had a truthfulness even from early girlhood
that the most artful and unscrupulous governess could not pollute,&mdash;that
she always <i>panted</i> for truth,&mdash;that flattery could not fool
nor baseness blind her,&mdash;that though she was a genius and master
of science, she was yet gentle and tolerant, and one whom no envy could
ruffle to retaliate pain.</p>
<p>In September of the same year she is a monster of unscrupulous deceit
and vindictive cruelty.&nbsp; Now, what had happened in the five months
between the dates of these poems to produce such a change of opinion?&nbsp;
Simply this:&mdash;</p>
<p>1st.&nbsp; The negotiation between him and his wife&rsquo;s lawyers
had ended in his signing a deed of separation in preference to standing
a suit for divorce.</p>
<p>2nd.&nbsp; Madame de Sta&euml;l, moved by his tears of anguish and
professions of repentance, had offered to negotiate with Lady Byron
on his behalf, and had failed.</p>
<p>The failure of this application is the only apology given by Moore
and Murray for this poem, which gentle Thomas Moore admits was not in
quite as generous a strain as the &lsquo;Fare thee well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Lord Byron knew perfectly well, when he suffered that application
to be made, that Lady Byron had been entirely convinced that her marriage
relations with him could never be renewed, and that duty both to man
and God required her to separate from him.&nbsp; The allowing the negotiation
was, therefore, an artifice to place his wife before the public in the
attitude of a hard-hearted, inflexible woman; her refusal was what he
knew beforehand must inevitably be the result, and merely gave him capital
in the sympathy of his friends, by which they should be brought to tolerate
and accept the bitter accusations of this poem.</p>
<p>We have recently heard it asserted that this last-named piece of
poetry was the sudden offspring of a fit of ill-temper, and was never
intended to be published at all.&nbsp; There were certainly excellent
reasons why his friends should have advised him not to publish it <i>at
that time</i>.&nbsp; But that it was read with sympathy by the circle
of his intimate friends, and believed by them, is evident from the frequency
with which allusions to it occur in his confidential letters to them.
<a name="citation21"></a><a href="#footnote21">{21}</a></p>
<p>About three months after, under date March 10, 1817, he writes to
Moore: &lsquo;I suppose now I shall never be able to shake off my sables
in public imagination, more particularly since my moral ----- clove
down my fame.&rsquo;&nbsp; Again to Murray in 1819, three years after,
he says: &lsquo;I never hear anything of Ada, the little Electra of
Mycenae.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Electra was the daughter of Clytemnestra, in the Greek poem, who
lived to condemn her wicked mother, and to call on her brother to avenge
the father.&nbsp; There was in this mention of Electra more than meets
the ear.&nbsp; Many passages in Lord Byron&rsquo;s poetry show that
he intended to make this daughter a future partisan against her mother,
and explain the awful words he is stated in Lady Anne Barnard&rsquo;s
diary to have used when first he looked on his little girl,&mdash;&lsquo;What
an instrument of torture I have gained in you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In a letter to Lord Blessington, April 6, 1823, he says, speaking
of Dr. Parr:&mdash; <a name="citation22a"></a><a href="#footnote22a">{22a}</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;He did me the honour once to be a patron of mine,
though a great friend of the other branch of the house of Atreus, and
the Greek teacher, I believe, of my moral Clytemnestra.&nbsp; I say
moral because it is true, and is so useful to the virtuous, that it
enables them to do anything without the aid of an &AElig;gistheus.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Lord Byron wrote this poem merely in a momentary fit of spleen,
why were there so many persons evidently quite familiar with his allusions
to it? and why was it preserved in Murray&rsquo;s hands? and why published
after his death?&nbsp; That Byron was in the habit of reposing documents
in the hands of Murray, to be used as occasion offered, is evident from
a part of a note written by him to Murray respecting some verses so
intrusted: &lsquo;Pray let not these <i>versiculi</i> go forth with
my name except <i>to the initiated</i>.&rsquo; <a name="citation22b"></a><a href="#footnote22b">{22b}</a></p>
<p>Murray, in publishing this attack on his wife after Lord Byron&rsquo;s
death, showed that he believed in it, and, so believing, deemed Lady
Byron a woman whose widowed state deserved neither sympathy nor delicacy
of treatment.&nbsp; At a time when every sentiment in the heart of the
most deeply wronged woman would forbid her appearing to justify herself
from such cruel slander of a dead husband, an honest, kind-hearted,
worthy Englishman actually thought it right and proper to give these
lines to her eyes and the eyes of all the reading world.&nbsp; Nothing
can show more plainly what this poem was written for, and how thoroughly
it did its work!&nbsp; Considering Byron as a wronged man, Murray thought
he was contributing his mite towards doing him justice.&nbsp; His editor
prefaced the whole set of &lsquo;Domestic Pieces&rsquo; with the following
statements:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;They all refer to the unhappy separation, of which
the precise causes are still a mystery, and which he declared to the
last were never disclosed to himself.&nbsp; He admitted that pecuniary
embarrassments, disordered health, and dislike to family restraints
had aggravated his naturally violent temper, and driven him to excesses.&nbsp;
He suspected that his mother-in-law had fomented the discord,&mdash;which
Lady Byron denies,&mdash;and that more was due to the malignant offices
of a female dependant, who is the subject of the bitterly satirical
sketch.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>&lsquo;To these general statements can only be added the still vaguer
allegations of Lady Byron, that she conceived his conduct to be the
result of insanity,&mdash;that, the physician pronouncing him responsible
for his actions, she could submit to them no longer, and that Dr. Lushington,
her legal adviser, agreed that a reconciliation was neither proper nor
possible.&nbsp; No weight can be attached to the opinions of an opposing
counsel upon accusations made by one party behind the back of the other,
who urgently demanded and was pertinaciously refused the least opportunity
of denial or defence.&nbsp; He rejected the proposal for an amicable
separation, but consented when threatened with a suit in Doctors&rsquo;
Commons.&rsquo; <a name="citation23"></a><a href="#footnote23">{23}</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Neither John Murray nor any of Byron&rsquo;s partisans seem to have
pondered the admission in these last words.</p>
<p>Here, as appears, was a woman, driven to the last despair, standing
with her child in her arms, asking from English laws protection for
herself and child against her husband.</p>
<p>She had appealed to the first counsel in England, and was acting
under their direction.</p>
<p>Two of the greatest lawyers in England have pronounced that there
has been such a cause of offence on his part that a return to him is
neither proper nor possible, and that no alternative remains to her
but separation or divorce.</p>
<p>He asks her to state her charges against him.&nbsp; She, making answer
under advice of her counsel, says, &lsquo;That if he <i>insists</i>
on the specifications, he must receive them in open court in a suit
for divorce.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What, now, ought to have been the conduct of any brave, honest man,
who believed that his wife was taking advantage of her reputation for
virtue to turn every one against him, who saw that she had turned on
her side even the lawyer he sought to retain on his; <a name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24">{24}</a>
that she was an unscrupulous woman, who acquiesced in every and any
thing to gain her ends, while he stood before the public, as he says,
&lsquo;accused of every monstrous vice, by public rumour or private
rancour&rsquo;?&nbsp; When she, under advice of her lawyers, made the
alternative legal <i>separation</i> or open investigation in court for
divorce, what did he do?</p>
<p>HE SIGNED THE ACT OF SEPARATION AND LEFT ENGLAND.</p>
<p>Now, let any man who knows the legal mind of England,&mdash;let any
lawyer who knows the character of Sir Samuel Romilly and Dr. Lushington,
ask whether <i>they</i> were the men to take a case into court for a
woman that had no <i>evidence</i> but her own statements and impressions?&nbsp;
Were <i>they</i> men to go to trial without proofs?&nbsp; Did they not
know that there were artful, hysterical women in the world, and would
<i>they</i>, of all people, be the men to take a woman&rsquo;s story
on her own side, and advise her in the last issue to bring it into open
court, without legal proof of the strongest kind?&nbsp; Now, as long
as Sir Samuel Romilly lived, this statement of Byron&rsquo;s&mdash;that
he was condemned unheard, and had no chance of knowing whereof he <i>was
accused&mdash;never appeared in public</i>.</p>
<p>It, however, was most actively circulated in <i>private</i>.&nbsp;
That Byron was in the habit of intrusting to different confidants articles
of various kinds to be shown to different circles as they could bear
them, we have already shown.&nbsp; We have recently come upon another
instance of this kind.&nbsp; In the late eagerness to exculpate Byron,
a new document has turned up, of which Mr. Murray, it appears, had never
heard when, after Byron&rsquo;s death, he published in the preface to
his &lsquo;Domestic Pieces&rsquo; the sentence: <i>&lsquo;He rejected
the proposal for an amicable separation, but consented when threatened
with a suit in Doctors&rsquo; Commons</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; It appears that,
up to 1853, neither John Murray senior, nor the son who now fills his
place, had taken any notice of this newly found document, which we are
now informed was drawn up by Lord Byron in August 1817, while Mr. Hobhouse
was staying with him at La Mira, near Venice, given to Mr. Matthew Gregory
Lewis, <i>for circulation among friends in England</i>, found in Mr.
Lewis&rsquo;s papers after his death, and <i>now</i> in the possession
of Mr. Murray.&rsquo;&nbsp; Here it is:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;It has been intimated to me that the persons understood
to be the legal advisers of Lady Byron have declared &ldquo;their lips
to be sealed up&rdquo; on the cause of the separation between her and
myself.&nbsp; If their lips are sealed up, they are not sealed up by
me, and the greatest favour they can confer upon me will be to open
them.&nbsp; From the first hour in which I was apprised of the intentions
of the Noel family to the last communication between Lady Byron and
myself in the character of wife and husband (a period of some months),
I called repeatedly and in vain for a statement of their or her charges,
and it was chiefly in consequence of Lady Byron&rsquo;s claiming (in
a letter still existing) a promise on my part to consent to a separation,
if such was really her wish, that I consented at all; this claim, and
the exasperating and inexpiable manner in which their object was pursued,
which rendered it next to an impossibility that two persons so divided
could ever be reunited, induced me reluctantly then, and repentantly
still, to sign the deed, which I shall be happy&mdash;most happy&mdash;to
cancel, and go before any tribunal which may discuss the business in
the most public manner.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Hobhouse made this proposition on my part, viz. to abrogate
all prior intentions&mdash;and go into court&mdash;the very day before
the separation was signed, and it was declined by the other party, as
also the publication of the correspondence during the previous discussion.&nbsp;
Those propositions I beg here to repeat, and to call upon her and hers
to say their worst, pledging myself to meet their allegations,&mdash;whatever
they may be,&mdash;and only too happy to be informed at last of their
real nature.</p>
<p>&lsquo;BYRON.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;August 9, 1817.</p>
<p>&lsquo;P.S.&mdash;I have been, and am now, utterly ignorant of what
description her allegations, charges, or whatever name they may have
assumed, are; and am as little aware for what purpose they have been
kept back,&mdash;unless it was to sanction the most infamous calumnies
by silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;BYRON.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;La Mira, near Venice.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears the circulation of this document must have been <i>very
private</i>, since Moore, not <i>over</i>-delicate towards Lady Byron,
did not think fit to print it; since John Murray neglected it, and since
it has come out at this late hour for the first time.</p>
<p>If Lord Byron really desired Lady Byron and her legal counsel to
understand the facts herein stated, and was willing at all hazards to
bring on an open examination, why was this <i>privately</i> circulated?&nbsp;
Why not issued as a card in the London papers?&nbsp; Is it likely that
Mr. Matthew Gregory Lewis, and a chosen band of friends acting as a
committee, requested an audience with Lady Byron, Sir Samuel Romilly,
and Dr. Lushington, and formally presented this cartel of defiance?</p>
<p>We incline to think not.&nbsp; We incline to think that this small
serpent, in company with many others of like kind, crawled secretly
and privately around, and when it found a good chance, bit an honest
Briton, whose blood was thenceforth poisoned by an undetected falsehood.</p>
<p>The reader now may turn to the letters that Mr. Moore has thought
fit to give us of this stay at La Mira, beginning with Letter 286, dated
July 1, 1817, <a name="citation28a"></a><a href="#footnote28a">{28a}</a>
where he says: &lsquo;I have been working up my impressions into a <i>Fourth</i>
Canto of Childe Harold,&rsquo; and also &lsquo;Mr. Lewis is in Venice.&nbsp;
I am going up to stay a week with him there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Next, under date La Mira, Venice, July 10, <a name="citation28b"></a><a href="#footnote28b">{28b}</a>
he says, &lsquo;Monk Lewis is here; how pleasant!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Next, under date July 20, 1817, to Mr. Murray: &lsquo;I write to
give you notice that I have <i>completed the fourth and ultimate canto
of Childe Harold</i>. . . .&nbsp; It is yet to be copied and polished,
and the notes are to come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Under date of La Mira, August 7, 1817, he records that the new canto
is one hundred and thirty stanzas in length, and talks about the price
for it.&nbsp; He is now ready to launch it on the world; and, as now
appears, on August 9, 1817, <i>two days after</i>, he wrote the document
above cited, and put it into the hands of Mr. Lewis, as we are informed,
&lsquo;for circulation among friends in England.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The reason of this may now be evident.&nbsp; Having prepared a suitable
number of those whom he calls in his notes to Murray &lsquo;the initiated,&rsquo;
by private documents and statements, he is now prepared to publish his
accusations against his wife, and the story of his wrongs, in a great
immortal poem, which shall have a band of initiated interpreters, shall
be read through the civilised world, and stand to accuse her after his
death.</p>
<p>In the Fourth Canto of &lsquo;Childe Harold,&rsquo; with all his
own overwhelming power of language, he sets forth his cause as against
the silent woman who all this time had been making no party, and telling
no story, and whom the world would therefore conclude to be silent because
she had no answer to make.&nbsp; I remember well the time when this
poetry, so resounding in its music, so mournful, so apparently generous,
filled my heart with a vague anguish of sorrow for the sufferer, and
of indignation at the cold insensibility that had maddened him.&nbsp;
Thousands have felt the power of this great poem, which stands, and
must stand to all time, a monument of what sacred and solemn powers
God gave to this wicked man, and how vilely he abused this power as
a weapon to slay the innocent.</p>
<p>It is among the ruins of ancient Rome that his voice breaks forth
in solemn imprecation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;O Time, thou beautifier of the dead,<br />
Adorner of the ruin, comforter,<br />
And only healer when the heart hath bled!&mdash;<br />
Time, the corrector when our judgments err,<br />
The test of truth, love,&mdash;sole philosopher,<br />
For all besides are sophists,&mdash;from thy shrift<br />
That never loses, though it doth defer!&mdash;<br />
Time, the avenger! unto thee I lift<br />
My hands and heart and eyes, and claim of thee a gift.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>&lsquo;If thou hast ever seen me too elate,<br />
Hear me not; but if calmly I have borne<br />
Good, and reserved my pride against the hate<br />
Which shall not whelm me, let me not have worn<br />
This iron in my soul in vain, shall THEY not mourn?<br />
And thou who never yet of human wrong<br />
Left the unbalanced scale, great Nemesis,<br />
Here where the ancients paid their worship long,<br />
Thou who didst call the Furies from the abyss,<br />
And round Orestes bid them howl and hiss<br />
For that unnatural retribution,&mdash;just<br />
Had it but come from hands less near,&mdash;in this<br />
Thy former realm I call thee from the dust.<br />
Dost thou not hear, my heart? awake thou shalt and must!<br />
It is not that I may not have incurred<br />
For my ancestral faults and mine, the wound<br />
Wherewith I bleed withal, and had it been conferred<br />
With a just weapon it had flowed unbound,<br />
But now my blood shall not sink in the ground.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>&lsquo;But in this page a record will I seek;<br />
Not in the air shall these my words disperse,<br />
Though I be ashes,&mdash;a far hour shall wreak<br />
The deep prophetic fulness of this verse,<br />
And pile on human heads the mountain of my curse.<br />
That curse shall be forgiveness.&nbsp; Have I not,&mdash;<br />
Hear me, my Mother Earth! behold it, Heaven,&mdash;<br />
Have I not had to wrestle with my lot?<br />
Have I not suffered things to be forgiven?<br />
Have I not had my brain seared, my heart riven,<br />
Hopes sapped, name blighted, life&rsquo;s life lied away,<br />
And only not to desperation driven,<br />
Because not altogether of such clay<br />
As rots into the soul of those whom I survey?</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>&lsquo;From mighty wrongs to petty perfidy,<br />
Have I not seen what human things could do,&mdash;<br />
From the loud roar of foaming calumny,<br />
To the small whispers of the paltry few,<br />
And subtler venom of the reptile crew,<br />
The Janus glance of whose significant eye,<br />
Learning to lie with silence, would seem true,<br />
And without utterance, save the shrug or sigh,<br />
Deal round to happy fools its speechless obloquy?&rsquo; <a name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31">{31}</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reader will please notice that the lines in italics are almost,
word for word, a repetition of the lines in italics in the former poem
on his wife, where he speaks of a<i> significant eye</i> that has <i>learned
to lie in silence</i>, and were evidently meant to apply to Lady Byron
and her small circle of confidential friends.</p>
<p>Before this, in the Third Canto of &lsquo;Childe Harold,&rsquo; he
had claimed the sympathy of the world, as a loving father, deprived
by a severe fate of the solace and society of his only child:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;My daughter,&mdash;with this name my song began,&mdash;<br />
My daughter,&mdash;with this name my song shall end,&mdash;<br />
I see thee not and hear thee not, but none<br />
Can be so wrapped in thee; thou art the friend<br />
To whom the shadows of far years extend.</p>
<p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</p>
<p>&lsquo;To aid thy mind&rsquo;s developments, to watch<br />
The dawn of little joys, to sit and see<br />
Almost thy very growth, to view thee catch<br />
Knowledge of objects,&mdash;wonders yet to thee,&mdash;<br />
And print on thy soft cheek a parent&rsquo;s kiss;&mdash;<br />
This it should seem was not reserved for me.<br />
Yet this was in my nature,&mdash;as it is,<br />
I know not what there is, yet something like to this.</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet though dull hate as duty should be taught,<br />
I know that thou wilt love me; though my name<br />
Should be shut out from thee as spell still fraught<br />
With desolation and a broken claim,<br />
Though the grave close between us,&mdash;&rsquo;t were the same<br />
I know that thou wilt love me, though to drain<br />
My blood from out thy being were an aim<br />
And an attainment,&mdash;all will be in vain.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To all these charges against her, sent all over the world in verses
as eloquent as the English language is capable of, the wife replied
nothing.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Assailed by slander and the tongue of strife,<br />
Her only answer was,&mdash;a blameless life.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She had a few friends, a very few, with whom she sought solace and
sympathy.&nbsp; One letter from her, written at this time, preserved
by accident, is the only authentic record of how the matter stood with
her.</p>
<p>We regret to say that the publication of this document was not brought
forth to clear Lady Byron&rsquo;s name from her husband&rsquo;s slanders,
but to shield <i>him</i> from the worst accusation against him, by showing
that this crime was not included in the few private confidential revelations
that friendship wrung from the young wife at this period.</p>
<p>Lady Anne Barnard, authoress of &lsquo;Auld Robin Grey,&rsquo; a
friend whose age and experience made her a proper confidante, sent for
the broken-hearted, perplexed wife, and offered her a woman&rsquo;s
sympathy.</p>
<p>To her Lady Byron wrote many letters, under seal of confidence, and
Lady Anne says: &lsquo;I will give you a few paragraphs transcribed
from one of Lady Byron&rsquo;s own letters to me.&nbsp; It is sorrowful
to think that in a very little time this young and amiable creature,
wise, patient, and feeling, will have her character mistaken by every
one who reads Byron&rsquo;s works.&nbsp; To rescue her from this I preserved
her letters, and when she afterwards expressed a fear that anything
of her writing should ever fall into hands to injure him (I suppose
she meant by publication), I safely assured her that it never should.&nbsp;
But here this letter shall be placed, a sacred record in her favour,
unknown to herself.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I am a very incompetent judge of the impression
which the last Canto of &ldquo;Childe Harold&rdquo; may produce on the
minds of indifferent readers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It contains the usual trace of a conscience restlessly awake,
though his object has been too long to aggravate its burden, as if it
could thus be oppressed into eternal stupor.&nbsp; I will hope, as you
do, that it survives for his ultimate good.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was the acuteness of his remorse, impenitent in its character,
which so long seemed to demand from my compassion to spare every semblance
of reproach, every look of grief, which might have said to his conscience,
&ldquo;You have made me wretched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am decidedly of opinion that he is responsible.&nbsp; He
has wished to be thought partially deranged, or on the brink of it,
to perplex observers and prevent them from tracing effects to their
real causes through all the intricacies of his conduct.&nbsp; I was,
as I told you, at one time the dupe of his acted insanity, and clung
to the former delusions in regard to the motives that concerned me personally,
till the whole system was laid bare.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He is the absolute monarch of words, and uses them, as Bonaparte
did lives, for conquest, without more regard to their intrinsic value,
considering them only as ciphers, which must derive all their import
from the situation in which he places them, and the ends to which he
adapts them, with such consummate skill.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, then, you will say, does he not employ them to give a
better colour to his own character?&nbsp; Because he is too good an
actor to over-act, or to assume a moral garb, which it would be easy
to strip off.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In regard to his poetry, egotism is the vital principle of
his imagination, which it is difficult for him to kindle on any subject
with which his own character and interests are not identified; but by
the introduction of fictitious incidents, by change of scene or time,
he has enveloped his poetical disclosures in a system impenetrable except
to a very few; and his constant desire of creating a sensation makes
him not averse to be the object of wonder and curiosity, even though
accompanied by some dark and vague suspicions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing has contributed more to the misunderstanding of his
real character than the lonely grandeur in which he shrouds it, and
his affectation of being above mankind, when he exists almost in their
voice.&nbsp; The romance of his sentiments is another feature of this
mask of state.&nbsp; I know no one more habitually destitute of that
enthusiasm he so beautifully expresses, and to which he can work up
his fancy chiefly by contagion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had heard he was the best of brothers, the most generous
of friends, and I thought such feelings only required to be warmed and
cherished into more diffusive benevolence.&nbsp; Though these opinions
are eradicated, and could never return but with the decay of my memory,
you will not wonder if there are still moments when the association
of feelings which arose from them soften and sadden my thoughts.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I have not thanked you, dearest Lady Anne, for your kindness
in regard to a principal object,&mdash;that of rectifying false impressions.&nbsp;
I trust you understand my wishes, which never were to injure Lord Byron
in any way; for, though he would not suffer me to remain his wife, he
cannot prevent me from continuing his friend; and it was from considering
myself as such that I silenced the accusations by which my own conduct
might have been more fully justified.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not necessary to speak ill of his heart in general;
it is sufficient that to me it was hard and impenetrable that my own
must have been broken before his could have been touched.&nbsp; I would
rather represent this as my misfortune than as his guilt; but, surely,
that misfortune is not to be made my crime!&nbsp; Such are my feelings;
you will judge how to act.</p>
<p>&lsquo;His allusions to me in &ldquo;Childe Harold&rdquo; are cruel
and cold, but with such a semblance as to make me appear so, and to
attract all sympathy to himself.&nbsp; It is said in this poem that
hatred of him will be taught as a lesson to his child.&nbsp; I might
appeal to all who have ever heard me speak of him, and still more to
my own heart, to witness that there has been no moment when I have remembered
injury otherwise than affectionately and sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not my duty to give way to hopeless and wholly unrequited
affection; but, so long as I live, my chief struggle will probably be
not to remember him too kindly.&nbsp; I do not seek the sympathy of
the world, but I wish to be known by those whose opinion is valuable
and whose kindness is dear to me.&nbsp; Among such, my dear Lady Anne,
you will ever be remembered by your truly affectionate</p>
<p>&lsquo;A. BYRON.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On this letter I observe Lord Lindsay remarks that it shows a noble
but rather severe character, and a recent author has remarked that it
seemed to be written rather in a &lsquo;cold spirit of criticism.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It seems to strike these gentlemen as singular that Lady Byron did not
enjoy the poem!&nbsp; But there are two remarkable sentences in this
letter which have escaped the critics hitherto.&nbsp; Lord Byron, in
this, the Third Canto of &lsquo;Childe Harold,&rsquo; expresses in most
affecting words an enthusiasm of love for his sister.&nbsp; So long
as he lived he was her faithful correspondent; he sent her his journals;
and, dying, he left her and her children everything he had in the world.&nbsp;
This certainly seems like an affectionate brother; but in what words
does Lady Byron speak of this affection?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I<i> had heard he was the best of brothers</i>, the most generous
of friends.&nbsp; I thought these feelings only required to be warmed
and cherished into more diffusive benevolence.&nbsp; THESE OPINIONS
ARE ERADICATED, AND COULD NEVER RETURN BUT WITH THE DECAY OF MEMORY.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Let me ask those who give this letter as a proof that at this time no
idea such as I have stated was in Lady Byron&rsquo;s mind, to account
for these words.&nbsp; Let them please answer these questions: Why had
Lady Byron ceased to think him a good brother?&nbsp; Why does she use
so strong a word as that the opinion was eradicated, torn up by the
roots, and could never grow again in her except by decay of memory?</p>
<p>And yet this is a document Lord Lindsay vouches for as authentic,
and which he brings forward <i>in defence</i> of Lord Byron.</p>
<p>Again she says, &lsquo;Though he <i>would not suffer me to remain
his wife</i>, he cannot prevent me from continuing his friend.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Do these words not say that in some past time, in some decided manner,
Lord Byron had declared to her his rejection of her as a wife?&nbsp;
I shall yet have occasion to explain these words.</p>
<p>Again she says, &lsquo;I silenced accusations by which my conduct
might have been more fully justified.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The people in England who are so very busy in searching out evidence
against my true story have searched out and given to the world an important
confirmation of this assertion of Lady Byron&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It seems that the confidential waiting-maid who went with Lady Byron
on her wedding journey has been sought out and interrogated, and, as
appears by description, is a venerable, respectable old person, quite
in possession of all her senses in general, and of that sixth sense
of propriety in particular, which appears not to be a common virtue
in our days.</p>
<p>As her testimony is important, we insert it just here, with a description
of her person in full.&nbsp; The ardent investigators thus speak:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Having gained admission, we were shown into a
small but neatly furnished and scrupulously clean apartment, where sat
the object of our visit.&nbsp; Mrs. Mimms is a venerable-looking old
lady, of short stature, slight and active appearance, with a singularly
bright and intelligent countenance.&nbsp; Although midway between eighty
and ninety years of age, she is in full possession of her faculties,
discourses freely and cheerfully, hears apparently as well as ever she
did, and her sight is so good that, aided by a pair of spectacles, she
reads the Chronicle every day with ease.&nbsp; Some idea of her competency
to contribute valuable evidence to the subject which now so much engages
public attention on three continents may be found from her own narrative
of her personal relations with Lady Byron.&nbsp; Mrs. Mimms was born
in the neighbourhood of Seaham, and knew Lady Byron from childhood.&nbsp;
During the long period of ten years she was Miss Milbanke&rsquo;s lady&rsquo;s-maid,
and in that capacity became the close confidante of her mistress.&nbsp;
There were circumstances which rendered their relationship peculiarly
intimate.&nbsp; Miss Milbanke had no sister or female friend to whom
she was bound by the ties of more than a common affection; and her mother,
whatever other excellent qualities she may have possessed, was too high-spirited
and too hasty in temper to attract the sympathies of the young.&nbsp;
Some months before Miss Milbanke was married to Lord Byron, Mrs. Mimms
had quitted her service on the occasion of her own marriage with Mr.
Mimms; but she continued to reside in the neighbourhood of Seaham, and
remained on the most friendly terms with her former mistress.&nbsp;
As the courtship proceeded, Miss Milbanke concealed nothing from her
faithful attendant; and when the wedding-day was fixed, she begged Mrs.
Mimms to return and fulfil the duties of lady&rsquo;s-maid, at least
during the honeymoon.&nbsp; Mrs. Mimms at the time was nursing her first
child, and it was no small sacrifice to quit her own home at such a
moment, but she could not refuse her old mistress&rsquo;s request.&nbsp;
Accordingly, she returned to Seaham Hall some days before the wedding,
was present at the ceremony, and then preceded Lord and Lady Byron to
Halnaby Hall, near Croft, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, one of Sir
Ralph Milbanke&rsquo;s seats, where the newly married couple were to
spend the honeymoon.&nbsp; Mrs. Mimms remained with Lord and Lady Byron
during the three weeks they spent at Halnaby Hall, and then accompanied
them to Seaham, where they spent the next six weeks.&nbsp; It was during
the latter period that she finally quitted Lady Byron&rsquo;s service;
but she remained in the most friendly communication with her ladyship
till the death of the latter, and for some time was living in the neighbourhood
of Lady Byron&rsquo;s residence in Leicestershire, where she had frequent
opportunities of seeing her former mistress.&nbsp; It may be added that
Lady Byron was not unmindful of the faithful services of her friend
and attendant in the instructions to her executors contained in her
will.&nbsp; Such was the position of Mrs. Mimms towards Lady Byron;
and we think no one will question that it was of a nature to entitle
all that Mrs. Mimms may say on the subject of the relations of Lord
and Lady Byron to the most respectful consideration and credit.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such is the chronicler&rsquo;s account of the faithful creature whom
nothing but intense indignation and disgust at Mrs. Beecher Stowe would
lead to speak on her mistress&rsquo;s affairs; but Mrs. Beecher Stowe
feels none the less sincere respect for her, and is none the less obliged
to her for having spoken.&nbsp; Much of Mrs. Mimms&rsquo;s testimony
will be referred to in another place; we only extract one passage, to
show that while Lord Byron spent his time in setting afloat slanders
against his wife, she spent hers in sealing the mouths of witnesses
against him.</p>
<p>Of the period of the honeymoon Mrs. Mimms says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The happiness of Lady Byron, however, was of brief
duration; even during the short three weeks they spent at Halnaby, the
irregularities of Lord Byron occasioned her the greatest distress, and
she even contemplated returning to her father.&nbsp; Mrs. Mimms was
her constant companion and confidante through this painful period, and
she does not believe that her ladyship concealed a thought from her.&nbsp;
With laudable reticence, the old lady absolutely refuses to disclose
the particulars of Lord Byron&rsquo;s misconduct at this time; she gave
Lady Byron a solemn promise not to do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
*</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;So serious did Mrs. Mimms consider the conduct
of Lord Byron, that she recommended her mistress to confide all the
circumstances to her father, Sir Ralph Milbanke, a calm, kind, and most
excellent parent, and take his advice as to her future course.&nbsp;
At one time Mrs. Mimms thinks Lady Byron had resolved to follow her
counsel and impart her wrongs to Sir Ralph; but on arriving at Seaham
Hall her ladyship strictly enjoined Mrs. Mimms to preserve absolute
silence on the subject&mdash;a course which she followed herself;&mdash;so
that when, six weeks later, she and Lord Byron left Seaham for London,
not a word had escaped her to disturb her parents&rsquo; tranquillity
as to their daughter&rsquo;s domestic happiness.&nbsp; As might be expected,
Mrs. Mimms bears the warmest testimony to the noble and lovable qualities
of her departed mistress.&nbsp; She also declares that Lady Byron was
by no means of a cold temperament, but that the affectionate impulses
of her nature were checked by the unkind treatment she experienced from
her husband.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have already shown that Lord Byron had been, ever since his separation,
engaged in a systematic attempt to reverse the judgment of the world
against himself, by making converts of all his friends to a most odious
view of his wife&rsquo;s character, and inspiring them with the zeal
of propagandists to spread these views through society.&nbsp; We have
seen how he prepared partisans to interpret the Fourth Canto of &lsquo;Childe
Harold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This plan of solemn and heroic accusation was the first public attack
on his wife.&nbsp; Next we see him commencing a scurrilous attempt to
turn her to ridicule in the First Canto of &lsquo;Don Juan.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is to our point now to show how carefully and cautiously this
Don Juan campaign was planned.</p>
<p>Vol. IV. p.138, we find Letter 325 to Mr. Murray:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Venice: January 25, 1819.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will do me the favour to print privately, for private
distribution, fifty copies of &ldquo;Don Juan.&rdquo;&nbsp; The list
of the men to whom I wish it presented I will send hereafter.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The poem, as will be remembered, begins with the meanest and foulest
attack on his wife that ever ribald wrote, and puts it in close neighbourhood
with scenes which every pure man or woman must feel to be the beastly
utterances of a man who had lost all sense of decency.&nbsp; Such a
potion was too strong to be administered even in a time when great license
was allowed, and men were not over-nice.&nbsp; But Byron chooses fifty
armour-bearers of that class of men who would find indecent ribaldry
about a wife a good joke, and talk about the &lsquo;artistic merits&rsquo;
of things which we hope would make an honest boy blush.</p>
<p>At this time he acknowledges that his vices had brought him to a
state of great exhaustion, attended by such debility of the stomach
that nothing remained on it; and adds, &lsquo;I was obliged to reform
my way of life, which was conducting me from the yellow leaf to the
ground with all deliberate speed.&rsquo; <a name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41">{41}</a>&nbsp;
But as his health is a little better he employs it in making the way
to death and hell elegantly easy for other young men, by breaking down
the remaining scruples of a society not over-scrupulous.</p>
<p>Society revolted, however, and fought stoutly against the nauseous
dose.&nbsp; His sister wrote to him that she heard such things said
of it that <i>she</i> never would read it; and the outcry against it
on the part of all women of his acquaintance was such that for a time
he was quite overborne; and the Countess Guiccioli finally extorted
a promise from him to cease writing it.&nbsp; Nevertheless, there came
a time when England accepted &lsquo;Don Juan,&rsquo;&mdash;when Wilson,
in the &lsquo;Noctes Ambrosianae,&rsquo; praised it as a classic, and
took every opportunity to reprobate Lady Byron&rsquo;s conduct.&nbsp;
When first it appeared the &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; came out with that
indignant denunciation of which we have spoken, and to which Byron replied
in the extracts we have already quoted.&nbsp; He did something more
than reply.&nbsp; He marked out Wilson as one of the strongest literary
men of the day, and set his &lsquo;initiated&rsquo; with their documents
to work upon him.</p>
<p>One of these documents to which he requested Wilson&rsquo;s attention
was the private autobiography, written expressly to give his own story
of all the facts of the marriage and separation.</p>
<p>In the indignant letter he writes Murray on the &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo;
article, Vol. IV., Letter 350&mdash;under date December 10, 1819&mdash;he
says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I sent home for Moore, and for Moore only (who
has my journal also), my memoir written up to 1816, and I gave him leave
to show it to whom he pleased, but not to publish on any account.&nbsp;
You may read it, and you may let Wilson read it if he likes&mdash;not
for his public opinion, but his private, for I like the man, and care
very little about the magazine.&nbsp; And I could wish Lady Byron herself
to read it, that she may have it in her power to mark any thing mistaken
or misstated.&nbsp; As it will never appear till after my extinction,
it would be but fair she should see it; that is to say, herself willing.&nbsp;
Your &ldquo;Blackwood&rdquo; accuses me of treating women harshly; but
I have been their martyr; my whole life has been sacrificed to them
and by them.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a part of Byron&rsquo;s policy to place Lady Byron in positions
before the world where she <i>could</i> not speak, and where her silence
would be set down to her as haughty, stony indifference and obstinacy.&nbsp;
Such was the pretended negotiation through Madame de Sta&euml;l, and
such now this apparently fair and generous offer to let Lady Byron see
and mark this manuscript.</p>
<p>The little Ada is now in her fifth year&mdash;a child of singular
sensibility and remarkable mental powers&mdash;one of those exceptional
children who are so perilous a charge for a mother.</p>
<p>Her husband proposes this artful snare to her,&mdash;that she shall
mark what is false in a statement which is all built on a damning lie,
that she cannot refute over that daughter&rsquo;s head,&mdash;and which
would perhaps be her ruin to discuss.</p>
<p>Hence came an addition of two more documents, to be used &lsquo;privately
among friends,&rsquo; <a name="citation43"></a><a href="#footnote43">{43}</a>
and which &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; uses after Lady Byron is safely out
of the world to cast ignominy on her grave&mdash;the wife&rsquo;s letter,
that of a mother standing at bay for her daughter, knowing that she
is dealing with a desperate, powerful, unscrupulous enemy.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Kirkby Mallory: March 10, 1820.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I received your letter of January 1, offering to my perusal
a Memoir of part of your life.&nbsp; I decline to inspect it.&nbsp;
I consider the publication or circulation of such a composition at any
time as prejudicial to Ada&rsquo;s future happiness.&nbsp; For my own
sake, I have no reason to shrink from publication; but, notwithstanding
the injuries which I have suffered, I should lament some of the consequences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;A. Byron.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To Lord Byron.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lord Byron, writing for the public, as is his custom, makes reply:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Ravenna: April 3, 1820.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I received yesterday your answer, dated March 10.&nbsp; My
offer was an honest one, and surely could only be construed as such
even by the most malignant casuistry.&nbsp; I could answer you, but
it is too late, and it is not worth while.&nbsp; To the mysterious menace
of the last sentence, whatever its import may be&mdash;and I cannot
pretend to unriddle it&mdash;I could hardly be very sensible even if
I understood it, as, before it can take place, I shall be where &ldquo;nothing
can touch him further.&rdquo; . . .&nbsp; I advise you, however, to
anticipate the period of your intention, for, be assured, no power of
figures can avail beyond the present; and if it could, I would answer
with the Florentine:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ed io, che posto son con loro in croce<br />
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e certo<br />
La fiera moglie, pi&ugrave; ch&rsquo;altro, mi nuoce.&rdquo; <a name="citation44"></a><a href="#footnote44">{44}</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;BYRON.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To Lady Byron.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two things are very evident in this correspondence: Lady Byron intimates
that, if he publishes his story, some <i>consequences</i> must follow
which she shall regret.</p>
<p>Lord Byron receives this as a threat, and says he doesn&rsquo;t understand
it.&nbsp; But directly after he says, &lsquo;Before IT can take place,
I shall be,&rsquo; etc.</p>
<p>The intimation is quite clear.&nbsp; He <i>does</i> understand what
the consequences alluded to are.&nbsp; They are evidently that Lady
Byron will speak out and tell her story.&nbsp; He says she cannot do
this till <i>after he is dead</i>, and then he shall not care.&nbsp;
In allusion to her accuracy as to dates and figures, he says: &lsquo;Be
assured no power of figures can avail beyond the present&rsquo; (life);
and then ironically <i>advises</i> her to <i>anticipate the period</i>,&mdash;i.e.
to speak out while he is alive.</p>
<p>In Vol. VI. Letter 518, which Lord Byron wrote to Lady Byron, but
did not send, he says: &lsquo;I burned your last note for two reasons,&mdash;firstly,
because it was written in a style not very agreeable; and, secondly,
because I wished to take your word without documents, which are the
resources of worldly and suspicious people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It would appear from this that there was a last letter of Lady Byron
to her husband, which he did not think proper to keep on hand, or show
to the &lsquo;initiated&rsquo; with his usual unreserve; that this letter
contained some kind of <i>pledge</i> for which he preferred to take
her word, <i>without documents</i>.</p>
<p>Each reader can imagine for himself what that <i>pledge</i> might
have been; but from the tenor of the three letters we should infer that
it was a promise of silence for his lifetime, on <i>certain conditions</i>,
and that the publication of the autobiography would violate those conditions,
and make it her duty to speak out.</p>
<p>This celebrated autobiography forms so conspicuous a figure in the
whole history, that the reader must have a full idea of it, as given
by Byron himself, in Vol. IV.&nbsp; Letter 344, to Murray:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I gave to Moore, who is gone to Rome, my life
in MS.,&mdash;in seventy-eight folio sheets, brought down to 1816 .
. . also a journal kept in 1814.&nbsp; Neither are for publication during
my life, but when I am cold you may do what you please.&nbsp; In the
mean time, if you like to read them you may, and show them to anybody
you like.&nbsp; I care not. . . . &rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He tells him also:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;You will find in it a detailed account of my marriage
and its consequences, as true as a party concerned can make such an
account.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the extent to which this autobiography was circulated we have
the following testimony of Shelton Mackenzie, in notes to &lsquo;The
Noctes&rsquo; of June 1824.</p>
<p>In &lsquo;The Noctes&rsquo; Odoherty says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The fact is, the work had been copied for the
private reading of a great lady in Florence.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The note says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The great lady in Florence, for whose private
reading Byron&rsquo;s autobiography was copied, was the Countess of
Westmoreland. . . .&nbsp; Lady Blessington had the autobiography in
her possession for weeks, and confessed to having copied every line
of it.&nbsp; Moore remonstrated, and she committed her copy to the flames,
but did not tell him that her sister, Mrs. Home Purvis, now Viscountess
of Canterbury, had also made a copy! . . .&nbsp; From the quantity of
copy I have seen,&mdash;and others were more in the way of falling in
with it than myself,&mdash;I surmise that at least half a dozen copies
were made, and of these five are now in existence.&nbsp; Some particular
parts, such as the marriage and separation, were copied separately;
but I think there cannot be less than five full copies yet to be found.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was written <i>after the original autobiography was burned</i>.</p>
<p>We may see the zeal and enthusiasm of the Byron party,&mdash;copying
seventy-eight folio sheets, as of old Christians copied the Gospels.&nbsp;
How widely, fully, and thoroughly, thus, by this secret process, was
society saturated with Byron&rsquo;s own versions of the story that
related to himself and wife!&nbsp; Against her there was only the complaint
of an absolute silence.&nbsp; She put forth no statements, no documents;
had no party, sealed the lips of her counsel, and even of her servants;
yet she could not but have known, from time to time, how thoroughly
and strongly this web of mingled truth and lies was being meshed around
her steps.</p>
<p>From the time that Byron first saw the importance of securing Wilson
on his side, and wrote to have his partisans attend to him, we may date
an entire revolution in the &lsquo;Blackwood.&rsquo;&nbsp; It became
Byron&rsquo;s warmest supporter,&mdash;is to this day the bitterest
accuser of his wife.</p>
<p>Why was this wonderful silence?&nbsp; It appears by Dr. Lushington&rsquo;s
statements, that, when Lady Byron did speak, she had a story to tell
that powerfully affected both him and Romilly,&mdash;a story supported
by evidence on which they were willing to have gone to public trial.&nbsp;
Supposing, now, she had imitated Lord Byron&rsquo;s example, and, avoiding
public trial, had put her story into private circulation; as he sent
&lsquo;Don Juan&rsquo; to fifty confidential friends, suppose she had
sent a written statement of her story to fifty judges as intelligent
as the two that had heard it; or suppose she had confronted his autobiography
with her own,&mdash;what would have been the result?</p>
<p>The first result might have been Mrs. Leigh&rsquo;s utter ruin.&nbsp;
The world may finally forgive the man of genius anything; but for a
woman there is no mercy and no redemption.</p>
<p>This ruin Lady Byron prevented by her utter silence and great self-command.&nbsp;
Mrs. Leigh never lost position.&nbsp; Lady Byron never so varied in
her manner towards her as to excite the suspicions even of her confidential
old servant.</p>
<p>To protect Mrs. Leigh effectually, it must have been necessary to
continue to exclude even her own mother from the secret, as we are assured
she did at first; for, had she told Lady Milbanke, it is not possible
that so high-spirited a woman could have restrained herself from such
outward expressions as would at least have awakened suspicion.&nbsp;
There was no resource but this absolute silence.</p>
<p>Lady Blessington, in her last conversation with Lord Byron, thus
describes the life Lady Byron was leading.&nbsp; She speaks of her as
&lsquo;wearing away her youth in almost monastic seclusion, questioned
by some, appreciated by few, seeking consolation alone in the discharge
of her duties, and avoiding all external demonstrations of a grief that
her pale cheek and solitary existence alone were vouchers for.&rsquo;
<a name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49">{49}</a></p>
<p>The main object of all this silence may be imagined, if we remember
that if Lord Byron had not died,&mdash;had he truly and deeply repented,
and become a thoroughly good man, and returned to England to pursue
a course worthy of his powers, there was on record neither word nor
deed from his wife to stand in his way.</p>
<p>HIS PLACE WAS KEPT IN SOCIETY, ready for him to return to whenever
he came clothed and in his right mind.&nbsp; He might have had the heart
and confidence of his daughter unshadowed by a suspicion.&nbsp; He might
have won the reverence of the great and good in his own lands and all
lands.&nbsp; That hope, which was the strong support, the prayer of
the silent wife, it did not please God to fulfil.</p>
<p>Lord Byron died a worn-out man at thirty-six.&nbsp; But the bitter
seeds he had sown came up, after his death, in a harvest of thorns over
his grave; and there were not wanting hands to use them as instruments
of torture on the heart of his widow.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III.&nbsp; R&Eacute;SUM&Eacute; OF THE CONSPIRACY.</h3>
<p>We have traced the conspiracy of Lord Byron against his wife up to
its latest device.&nbsp; That the reader&rsquo;s mind may be clear on
the points of the process, we shall now briefly recapitulate the documents
in the order of time.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; March 17, 1816.&mdash;While negotiations for separation
were pending,&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Fare thee well, and if for ever</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While writing these pages, we have received from England the testimony
of one who has seen the original draught of that &lsquo;Fare thee well.&rsquo;&nbsp;
This original copy had evidently been subjected to the most careful
and acute revision.&nbsp; Scarcely two lines that were not interlined,
scarcely an adjective that was not exchanged for a better; showing that
the noble lord was not so far overcome by grief as to have forgotten
his reputation.&nbsp; (Found its way to the public prints through the
imprudence of <i>a</i> <i>friend</i>.)</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; March 29, 1816.&mdash;An attack on Lady Byron&rsquo;s old
governess for having been born poor, for being homely, and for having
unduly influenced his wife against him; promising that her grave should

Romilly of taking his retainer, and then going over to the adverse party,
etc.&nbsp; (Printed for <i>private circulation</i>; to be found in the
standard English edition of Murray, vol. ix. p.57.)</p>
<p>To this condensed account of Byron&rsquo;s strategy we must add the
crowning stroke of policy which transmitted this warfare to his friends,
to be continued after his death.</p>
<p>During the last visit Moore made him in Italy, and just before Byron
presented to him his &lsquo;Autobiography,&rsquo; the following scene
occurred, as narrated by Moore (vol. iv. p.221):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The chief subject of conversation, when alone,
was his marriage, and the load of obloquy which it had brought upon
him.&nbsp; He was most anxious to know the worst that had been alleged
of his conduct; and, as this was our first opportunity of speaking together
on the subject, I did not hesitate to put his candour most searchingly
to the proof, not only by enumerating the various charges I had heard
brought against him by others, but by specifying such portions of these
charges as I had been inclined to think not incredible myself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To all this he listened with patience, and answered with the
most unhesitating frankness; laughing to scorn the tales of unmanly
outrage related of him, but at the same time acknowledging that there
had been in his conduct but too much to blame and regret, and stating
one or two occasions during his domestic life when he had been irritated
into letting the &ldquo;breath of bitter words&rdquo; escape him,. .
.&nbsp; which he now evidently remembered with a degree of remorse and
pain which might well have entitled them to be forgotten by others.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was, at the same time, manifest, that, whatever admissions
he might be inclined to make respecting his own delinquencies, the inordinate
measure of the punishment dealt out to him had sunk deeply into his
mind, and, with the usual effect of such injustice, drove him also to
be unjust himself; so much so, indeed, as to impute to the quarter to
which he now traced all his ill fate a feeling of fixed hostility to
himself, which would not rest, he thought, even at his grave, but continue
to persecute his memory as it was now embittering his life.&nbsp; So
strong was this impression upon him, that, during one of our few intervals
of seriousness, he conjured me by our friendship, if, as he both felt
and hoped, I should survive him, not to let unmerited censure settle
upon his name.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this same account, page 218, Moore testifies that</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Lord Byron disliked his countrymen, but only because
he knew that his morals were held in contempt by them.&nbsp; The English,
themselves rigid observers of family duties, could not pardon him the
neglect of his, nor his trampling on principles; therefore, neither
did he like being presented to them, nor did they, especially when they
had wives with them, like to cultivate his acquaintance.&nbsp; Still
there was a strong desire in all of them to see him; and the women in
particular, who did not dare to look at him but by stealth, said in
an under-voice, &ldquo;What a pity it is!&rdquo;&nbsp; If, however,
any of his compatriots of exalted rank and high reputation came forward
to treat him with courtesy, he showed himself obviously flattered by
it.&nbsp; It seemed that, to the wound which remained open in his ulcerated
heart, such soothing attentions were as drops of healing balm, which
comforted him.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When in society, we are further informed by a lady quoted by Mr.
Moore, he was in the habit of speaking of his wife with much respect
and affection, as an illustrious lady, distinguished for her qualities
of heart and understanding; saying that all the fault of their cruel
separation lay with himself.&nbsp; Mr. Moore seems at times to be somewhat
puzzled by these contradictory statements of his idol, and speculates
not a little on what could be Lord Byron&rsquo;s object in using such
language in public; mentally comparing it, we suppose, with the free
handling which he gave to the same subject in his private correspondence.</p>
<p>The innocence with which Moore gives himself up to be manipulated
by Lord Byron, the <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> with which he shows all
the process, let us a little into the secret of the marvellous powers
of charming and blinding which this great actor possessed.</p>
<p>Lord Byron had the beauty, the wit, the genius, the dramatic talent,
which have constituted the strength of some wonderfully fascinating
women.</p>
<p>There have been women able to lead their leashes of blinded adorers;
to make them swear that black was white, or white black, at their word;
to smile away their senses, or weep away their reason.&nbsp; No matter
what these sirens may say, no matter what they may do, though caught
in a thousand transparent lies, and doing a thousand deeds which would
have ruined others, still men madly rave after them in life, and tear
their hair over their graves.&nbsp; Such an enchanter in man&rsquo;s
shape was Lord Byron.</p>
<p>He led captive Moore and Murray by being beautiful, a genius, and
a lord; calling them &lsquo;Dear Tom&rsquo; and &lsquo;Dear Murray,&rsquo;
while they were only commoners.&nbsp; He first insulted Sir Walter Scott,
and then witched his heart out of him by ingenuous confessions and poetical
compliments; he took Wilson&rsquo;s heart by flattering messages and
a beautifully-written letter; he corresponded familiarly with Hogg;
and, before his death, had made fast friends, in one way or another,
of the whole &lsquo;Noctes Ambrosianae&rsquo; Club.</p>
<p>We thus have given the historical <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of
Lord Byron&rsquo;s attacks on his wife&rsquo;s reputation: we shall
add, that they were based on philosophic principles, showing a deep
knowledge of mankind.&nbsp; An analysis will show that they can be philosophically
classified:&mdash;</p>
<p>1st.&nbsp; Those which addressed the sympathetic nature of man, representing
her as cold, methodical, severe, strict, unforgiving.</p>
<p>2nd.&nbsp; Those addressed to the faculty of association, connecting
her with ludicrous and licentious images; taking from her the usual
protection of womanly delicacy and sacredness.</p>
<p>3rd.&nbsp; Those addressed to the moral faculties, accusing her as
artful, treacherous, untruthful, malignant.</p>
<p>All these various devices he held in his hand, shuffling and dealing
them as a careful gamester his pack of cards according to the exigencies
of the game.&nbsp; He played adroitly, skilfully, with blinding flatteries
and seductive wiles, that made his victims willing dupes.</p>
<p>Nothing can more clearly show the power and perfectness of his enchantments
than the masterly way in which he turned back the moral force of the
whole English nation, which had risen at first in its strength against
him.&nbsp; The victory was complete.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV.&nbsp; RESULTS AFTER LORD BYRON&rsquo;S DEATH.</h3>
<p>At the time of Lord Byron&rsquo;s death, the English public had been
so skilfully manipulated by the Byron propaganda, that the sympathy
of the whole world was with him.&nbsp; A tide of emotion was now aroused
in England by his early death&mdash;dying in the cause of Greece and
liberty.&nbsp; There arose a general wail for him, as for a lost pleiad,
not only in England, but over the whole world; a great rush of enthusiasm
for his memory, to which the greatest literary men of England freely
gave voice.&nbsp; By general consent, Lady Byron seems to have been
looked upon as the only cold-hearted unsympathetic person in this general
mourning.</p>
<p>From that time the literary world of England apparently regarded
Lady Byron as a woman to whom none of the decorums, nor courtesies of
ordinary womanhood, nor even the consideration belonging to common humanity,
were due.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She that is a widow indeed, and desolate,&rsquo; has been
regarded in all Christian countries as an object made sacred by the
touch of God&rsquo;s afflicting hand, sacred in her very helplessness;
and the old Hebrew Scriptures give to the Supreme Father no dearer title
than &lsquo;the widow&rsquo;s God.&rsquo;&nbsp; But, on Lord Byron&rsquo;s
death, men not devoid of tenderness, men otherwise generous and of fine
feeling, acquiesced in insults to his widow with an obtuseness that
seems, on review, quite incredible.</p>
<p>Lady Byron was not only a widow, but an orphan.&nbsp; She had no
sister for confidante; no father and mother to whom to go in her sorrows&mdash;sorrows
so much deeper and darker to her than they could be to any other human
being.&nbsp; She had neither son nor brother to uphold and protect her.&nbsp;
On all hands it was acknowledged that, so far, there was no fault to
be found in her but her utter silence.&nbsp; Her life was confessed
to be pure, useful, charitable; and yet, in this time of her sorrow,
the writers of England issued article upon article not only devoid of
delicacy, but apparently injurious and insulting towards her, with a
blind unconsciousness which seems astonishing.</p>
<p>One of the greatest literary powers of that time was the &lsquo;Blackwood:&rsquo;
the reigning monarch on that literary throne was Wilson, the lion-hearted,
the brave, generous, tender poet, and, with some sad exceptions, the
noble man.&nbsp; But Wilson had believed the story of Byron, and, by
his very generosity and tenderness and pity, was betrayed into injustice.</p>
<p>In &lsquo;The Noctes&rsquo; of November 1824 there is a conversation
of the Noctes Club, in which North says, &lsquo;Byron and I knew each
other pretty well; and I suppose there&rsquo;s no harm in adding, that
we appreciated each other pretty tolerably.&nbsp; Did you ever see his
letter to me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The footnote to this says, <i>&lsquo;This letter, which was</i> PRINTED
<i>in Byron&rsquo;s lifetime, was not published till</i> 1830, when
it appeared in Moore&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life of Byron.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
one of the most vigorous prose compositions in the language.&nbsp; Byron
had the highest opinion of Wilson&rsquo;s genius and noble spirit.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the first place, with our present ideas of propriety and good
taste, we should reckon it an indecorum to make the private affairs
of a pure and good woman, whose circumstances under any point of view
were trying, and who evidently shunned publicity, the subject of public
discussion in magazines which were read all over the world.</p>
<p>Lady Byron, as they all knew, had on her hands a most delicate and
onerous task, in bringing up an only daughter, necessarily inheriting
peculiarities of genius and great sensitiveness; and the many mortifications
and embarrassments which such intermeddling with her private matters
must have given, certainly should have been considered by men with any
pretensions to refinement or good feeling.</p>
<p>But the literati of England allowed her no consideration, no rest,
no privacy.</p>
<p>In &lsquo;The Noctes&rsquo; of November 1825 there is the record
of a free conversation upon Lord and Lady Byron&rsquo;s affairs, interlarded
with exhortations to push the bottle, and remarks on whisky-toddy.&nbsp;
Medwin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Conversations with Lord Byron&rsquo; is discussed,
which, we are told in a note, appeared a few months after the <i>noble</i>
poet&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>There is a rather bold and free discussion of Lord Byron&rsquo;s
character&mdash;his fondness for gin and water, on which stimulus he
wrote &lsquo;Don Juan;&rsquo; and James Hogg says pleasantly to Mullion,
&lsquo;O Mullion! it&rsquo;s a pity you and Byron could na ha&rsquo;
been acquaint.&nbsp; There would ha&rsquo; been brave sparring to see
who could say the wildest and the dreadfullest things; for he had neither
fear of man or woman, and would ha&rsquo; his joke or jeer, cost what
it might.&rsquo;&nbsp; And then follows a specimen of one of his jokes
with an actress, that, in indecency, certainly justifies the assertion.&nbsp;
From the other stories which follow, and the parenthesis that occurs
frequently (&lsquo;Mind your glass, James, a little more!&rsquo;), it
seems evident that the party are progressing in their peculiar kind
of <i>civilisation</i>.</p>
<p>It is in this same circle and paper that Lady Byron&rsquo;s private
affairs come up for discussion.&nbsp; The discussion is thus elegantly
introduced:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Hogg.&mdash;&lsquo;Reach me the black bottle.&nbsp; I
say, Christopher, what, after all, is your opinion o&rsquo; Lord and
Leddy Byron&rsquo;s quarrel?&nbsp; Do you yoursel&rsquo; take part with
him, or with her?&nbsp; I wad like to hear your real opinion.&rsquo;</p>
<p>North.&mdash;&lsquo;Oh, dear!&nbsp; Well, Hogg, since you will have
it, I think Douglas Kinnard and Hobhouse are bound to tell us whether
there be any truth, and how much, in this story about the declaration,
signed by Sir Ralph&rsquo; [Milbanke].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The note here tells us that this refers to a statement that appeared
in &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; immediately after Byron&rsquo;s death, to
the effect that, previous to the formal separation from his wife, Byron
required and obtained from Sir Ralph Milbanke, Lady Byron&rsquo;s father,
a statement to the effect that Lady Byron had no charge of moral delinquency
to bring against him. <a name="citation61"></a><a href="#footnote61">{61}</a></p>
<p>North continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;And I think Lady Byron&rsquo;s letter&mdash;the
&ldquo;Dearest Duck&rdquo; one I mean&mdash;should really be forthcoming,
if her ladyship&rsquo;s friends wish to stand fair before the public.&nbsp;
At present we have nothing but loose talk of society to go upon; and
certainly, if the things that are said be true, there must be thorough
explanation from some quarter, or the tide will continue, as it has
assuredly begun, to flow in a direction very opposite to what we were
for years accustomed.&nbsp; Sir, they must explain this business of
the letter.&nbsp; You have, of course, heard about the invitation it
contained, the warm, affectionate invitation, to Kirkby Mallory&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hogg interposes,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I dinna like to be interruptin&rsquo; ye, Mr.
North; but I must inquire, Is the jug to stand still while ye&rsquo;re
going on at that rate?&rsquo;</p>
<p>North&mdash;&lsquo;There, Porker!&nbsp; These things are part and
parcel of the chatter of every bookseller&rsquo;s shop; &agrave; fortiori,
of every drawing-room in May Fair.&nbsp; Can the matter stop here?&nbsp;
Can a great man&rsquo;s memory be permitted to incur damnation while
these saving clauses are afloat anywhere uncontradicted?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from this the conversation branches off into strong, emphatic
praise of Byron&rsquo;s conduct in Greece during the last part of his
life.</p>
<p>The silent widow is thus delicately and considerately reminded in
the &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; that she is the talk, not only over the
whisky jug of the Noctes, but in every drawing-room in London; and that
she <i>must</i> speak out and explain matters, or the whole world will
set against her.</p>
<p>But she does not speak yet.&nbsp; The public persecution, therefore,
proceeds.&nbsp; Medwin&rsquo;s book being insufficient, another biographer
is to be selected.&nbsp; Now, the person in the Noctes Club who was
held to have the most complete information of the Byron affairs, and
was, on that account, first thought of by Murray to execute this very
delicate task of writing a memoir which should include the most sacred
domestic affairs of a noble lady and her orphan daughter, was <i>Maginn</i>.&nbsp;
Maginn, the author of the pleasant joke, that &lsquo;man never reaches
the apex of civilisation till he is too drunk to pronounce the word,&rsquo;
was the first person in whose hands the &lsquo;Autobiography,&rsquo;
Memoirs, and Journals of Lord Byron were placed with this view.</p>
<p>The following note from Shelton Mackenzie, in the June number of
&lsquo;The Noctes,&rsquo; 1824, says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;At that time, had he been so minded, Maginn (Odoherty)
could have got up a popular Life of Byron as well as most men in England.&nbsp;
Immediately on the account of Byron&rsquo;s death being received in
London, John Murray proposed that Maginn should bring out Memoirs, Journals,
and Letters of Lord Byron, and, with this intent, placed in his hand
every line that he (Murray) possessed in Byron&rsquo;s handwriting.
. . . .&nbsp; The strong desire of Byron&rsquo;s family and executors
that the &ldquo;Autobiography&rdquo; should be burned, to which desire
Murray foolishly yielded, made such an hiatus in the materials, that
Murray and Maginn agreed it would not answer to bring out the work then.&nbsp;
Eventually Moore executed it.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The character of the times in which this work was to be undertaken
will appear from the following note of Mackenzie&rsquo;s to &lsquo;The
Noctes&rsquo; of August 1824, which we copy, with the <i>author&rsquo;s
own Italics</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;In the &ldquo;Blackwood&rdquo; of July 1824 was
a poetical epistle by the renowned Timothy Tickler to the editor of
the &ldquo;John Bull&rdquo; magazine, on an article in his first number.&nbsp;
This article. . .&nbsp; professed to be a portion of the veritable &ldquo;Autobiography&rdquo;
of Byron which was burned, and was called &ldquo;My Wedding Night.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It appeared to relate in detail everything that occurred in the twenty-four
hours immediately succeeding that in which Byron was married.&nbsp;
It had plenty of coarseness, and some to spare.&nbsp; It went into particulars
such as hitherto had been given only by Faublas; and it had, notwithstanding,
many phrases and some facts which evidently did not belong to a mere
fabricator.&nbsp; Some years after, I compared this &ldquo;Wedding Night&rdquo;
with what I had all assurance of having been transcribed from the actual
manuscripts of Byron, and was persuaded that the magazine-writer must
have had the actual statement before him, or have had a perusal of it.&nbsp;
The writer in &ldquo;Blackwood&rdquo; declared his conviction that it
really was Byron&rsquo;s own writing.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reader must remember that Lord Byron died April 1824; so that,
according to this, his &lsquo;Autobiography&rsquo; was made the means
of this gross insult to his widow three months after his death.</p>
<p>If some powerful cause had not paralysed all feelings of gentlemanly
honour, and of womanly delicacy, and of common humanity, towards Lady
Byron, throughout the whole British nation, no editor would have dared
to open a periodical with such an article; or, if he had, he would have
been overwhelmed with a storm of popular indignation, which, like the
fire upon Sodom, would have made a pillar of salt of him for a warning
to all future generations.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; reproves the &lsquo;John Bull&rsquo; in a
poetical epistle, recognising the article as coming from Byron, and
says to the <i>author</i>,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;But that you, sir, a wit and a scholar like you,<br />
Should not blush to produce what he blushed not to do,&mdash;<br />
Take your compliment, youngster; this doubles, almost,<br />
The sorrow that rose when his honour was lost.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We may not wonder that the &lsquo;Autobiography&rsquo; was burned,
as Murray says in a recent account, by a committee of Byron&rsquo;s
<i>friends</i>, including Hobhouse, his sister, and Murray himself.</p>
<p>Now, the &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; of July 1824 thus declares its conviction
that this outrage on every sentiment of human decency came from Lord
Byron, and that his honour was lost.&nbsp; Maginn does not undertake
the memoir.&nbsp; No memoir at all is undertaken; till finally Moore
is selected, as, like Demetrius of old, a well-skilled gilder and &lsquo;maker
of silver shrines,&rsquo; though <i>not</i> for Diana.&nbsp; To Moore
is committed the task of doing his best for this battered image, in
which even the worshippers recognise foul sulphurous cracks, but which
they none the less stand ready to worship as a genuine article that
&lsquo;fell down from Jupiter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Moore was a man of no particular nicety as to moralities, but in
that matter seems not very much below what this record shows his average
associates to be.&nbsp; He is so far superior to Maginn, that his vice
is rose-coloured and refined.&nbsp; He does not burst out with such
heroic stanzas as Maginn&rsquo;s frank invitation to Jeremy Bentham:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Jeremy, throw your pen aside,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And come get drunk with me;<br />
And we&rsquo;ll go where Bacchus sits astride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Perched high on barrels three.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s vice is cautious, soft, seductive, slippery, and covered
at times with a thin, tremulous veil of religious sentimentalism.</p>
<p>In regard to Byron, he was an unscrupulous, committed partisan: he
was as much bewitched by him as ever man has been by woman; and therefore
to him, at last, the task of editing Byron&rsquo;s &lsquo;Memoirs&rsquo;
was given.</p>
<p>This Byron, whom they all knew to be obscene beyond what even their
most drunken tolerance could at first endure; this man, whose foul license
<i>spoke</i> <i>out</i> what most men conceal from mere respect to the
decent instincts of humanity; whose &lsquo;honour was lost,&rsquo;&mdash;was
submitted to this careful manipulator, to be turned out a perfected
idol for a world longing for an idol, as the Israelites longed for the
calf in Horeb.</p>
<p>The image was to be invested with deceitful glories and shifting
haloes,&mdash;admitted faults spoken of as peculiarities of sacred origin,&mdash;and
the world given to understand that no common rule or measure could apply
to such an undoubtedly divine production; and so the hearts of men were
to be wrung with pity for his sorrows as the yearning pain of a god,
and with anger at his injuries as sacrilege on the sacredness of genius,
till they were ready to cast themselves at his feet, and adore.</p>
<p>Then he was to be set up on a pedestal, like Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s
image on the plains of Dura; and what time the world heard the sound
of cornet, sackbut, and dulcimer, in his enchanting verse, they were
to fall down and worship.</p>
<p>For Lady Byron, Moore had simply the respect that a commoner has
for a lady of rank, and a good deal of the feeling that seems to underlie
all English literature,&mdash;that it is no matter what becomes of the
woman when the man&rsquo;s story is to be told.&nbsp; But, with all
his faults, Moore was not a cruel man; and we cannot conceive such outrageous
cruelty and ungentlemanly indelicacy towards an unoffending woman, as
he shows in these &lsquo;Memoirs,&rsquo; without referring them to Lord
Byron&rsquo;s own influence in making him an unscrupulous, committed
partisan on his side.</p>
<p>So little pity, so little sympathy, did he suppose Lady Byron to
be worthy of, that he laid before her, in the sight of all the world,
selections from her husband&rsquo;s letters and journals, in which the
privacies of her courtship and married life were jested upon with a
vulgar levity; letters filled, from the time of the act of separation,
with a constant succession of sarcasms, stabs, stings, epigrams, and
vindictive allusions to herself, bringing her into direct and insulting
comparison with his various mistresses, and implying their superiority
over her.&nbsp; There, too, were gross attacks on her father and mother,
as having been the instigators of the separation; and poor Lady Milbanke,
in particular, is sometimes mentioned with epithets so offensive, that
the editor prudently covers the terms with stars, as intending language
too gross to be printed.</p>
<p>The last mistress of Lord Byron is uniformly brought forward in terms
of such respect and consideration, that one would suppose that the usual
moral laws that regulate English family life had been specially repealed
in his favour.&nbsp; Moore quotes with approval letters from Shelley,
stating that Lord Byron&rsquo;s connection with La Guiccioli has been
of inestimable benefit to him; and that he is now becoming what he should
be, &lsquo;a virtuous man.&rsquo;&nbsp; Moore goes on to speak of the
connection as one, though somewhat reprehensible, yet as having all
those advantages of marriage and settled domestic ties that Byron&rsquo;s
affectionate spirit had long sighed for, but never before found; and
in his last <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of the poet&rsquo;s character,
at the end of the volume, he brings the</p>
<p>mistress into direct comparison with the wife in a single sentence:
&lsquo;The woman to whom he gave the love of his maturer years idolises
his name; and, with a <i>single unhappy exception</i>, scarce an instance
is to be found of one brought. . .&nbsp; into relations of amity with
him who did not retain a kind regard for him in life, and a fondness
for his memory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Literature has never yet seen the instance of a person, of Lady Byron&rsquo;s
rank in life, placed before the world in a position more humiliating
to womanly dignity, or wounding to womanly delicacy.</p>
<p>The direct implication is, that she has no feelings to be hurt, no
heart to be broken, and is not worthy even of the consideration which
in ordinary life is to be accorded to a widow who has received those
awful tidings which generally must awaken many emotions, and call for
some consideration, even in the most callous hearts.</p>
<p>The woman who we are told walked the room, vainly striving to control
the sobs that shook her frame, while she sought to draw from the servant
that last message of her husband which she was never to hear, was not
thought worthy even of the rights of common humanity.</p>
<p>The first volume of the &lsquo;Memoir&rsquo; came out in 1830.&nbsp;
Then for the first time came one flash of lightning from the silent
cloud; and she who had never spoken before spoke out.&nbsp; The libels
on the memory of her dead parents drew from her what her own wrongs
never did.&nbsp; During all this time, while her husband had been keeping
her effigy dangling before the public as a mark for solemn curses, and
filthy lampoons, and <i>secretly</i>-circulated disclosures, that spared
no sacredness and violated every decorum, she had not uttered a word.&nbsp;
She had been subjected to nameless insults, discussed in the assemblies
of drunkards, and challenged to speak for herself.&nbsp; Like the chaste
lady in &lsquo;Comus,&rsquo; whom the vile wizard had bound in the enchanted
seat to be &lsquo;grinned at and chattered at&rsquo; by all the filthy
rabble of his dehumanised rout, she had remained pure, lofty, and undefiled;
and the stains of mud and mire thrown upon her had fallen from her spotless
garments.</p>
<p>Now that she is dead, a recent writer in &lsquo;The London Quarterly&rsquo;
dares give voice to an insinuation which even Byron gave only a <i>suggestion</i>
of when he called his wife Clytemnestra; and hints that she tried the
power of youth and beauty to win to her the young solicitor Lushington,
and a handsome young officer of high rank.</p>
<p>At this time, such insinuations had not been thought of; and the
only and chief allegation against Lady Byron had been a cruel severity
of virtue.</p>
<p>At all events, when Lady Byron spoke, the world listened with respect,
and believed what she said.</p>
<p>Here let us, too, read her statement, and give it the careful attention
she solicits (Moore&rsquo;s &lsquo;Life of Byron,&rsquo; vol. vi. p.275):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I have disregarded various publications in which
facts within my own knowledge have been grossly misrepresented; but
I am called upon to notice some of the erroneous statements proceeding
from one who claims to be considered as Lord Byron&rsquo;s confidential
and authorised friend.&nbsp; Domestic details ought not to be intruded
on the public attention: if, however, they are so intruded, the persons
affected by them have a right to refute injurious charges.&nbsp; Mr.
Moore has promulgated his own impressions of private events in which
I was most nearly concerned, as if he possessed a competent knowledge
of the subject.&nbsp; Having survived Lord Byron, I feel increased reluctance
to advert to any circumstances connected with the period of my marriage;
nor is it now my intention to disclose them further than may be indispensably
requisite for the end I have in view.&nbsp; Self-vindication is not
the motive which actuates me to make this appeal, and the spirit of
accusation is unmingled with it; but when the conduct of my parents
is brought forward in a disgraceful light by the passages selected from
Lord Byron&rsquo;s letters, and by the remarks of his biographer, I
feel bound to justify their characters from imputations which I know
to be false.&nbsp; The passages from Lord Byron&rsquo;s letters, to
which I refer, are,&mdash;the aspersion on my mother&rsquo;s character
(p.648, l.4): <a name="citation70a"></a><a href="#footnote70a">{70a}</a>
&ldquo;My child is very well and flourishing, I hear; but I must see
also.&nbsp; I feel no disposition to resign it to the contagion of its
grandmother&rsquo;s society.&rdquo;&nbsp; The assertion of her dishonourable
conduct in employing a spy (p.645, l.7, etc.): &ldquo;A Mrs. C. (now
a kind of housekeeper and spy of Lady N&rsquo;s), who, in her better
days, was a washerwoman, is supposed to be&mdash;by the learned&mdash;very
much the occult cause of our domestic discrepancies.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
seeming exculpation of myself in the extract (p.646), with the words
immediately following it, &ldquo;Her nearest relations are a&mdash;-;&rdquo;
where the blank clearly implies something too offensive for publication.&nbsp;
These passages tend to throw suspicion on my parents, and give reason
to ascribe the separation either to their direct agency, or to that
of &ldquo;officious spies&rdquo; employed by them. <a name="citation70b"></a><a href="#footnote70b">{70b}</a>&nbsp;
From the following part of the narrative (p.642), it must also be inferred
that an undue influence was exercised by them for the accomplishment
of this purpose: &ldquo;It was in a few weeks after the latter communication
between us (Lord Byron and Mr. Moore) that Lady Byron adopted the determination
of parting from him.&nbsp; She had left London at the latter end of
January, on a visit to her father&rsquo;s house in Leicestershire; and
Lord Byron was in a short time to follow her.&nbsp; They had parted
in the utmost kindness, she wrote him a letter, full of playfulness
and affection, on the road; and, immediately on her arrival at Kirkby
Mallory, her father wrote to acquaint Lord Byron that she would return
to him no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In my observations upon this statement, I shall, as far as
possible, avoid touching on any matters relating personally to Lord
Byron and myself.&nbsp; The facts are,&mdash;I left London for Kirkby
Mallory, the residence of my father and mother, on the 15th of January,
1816.&nbsp; Lord Byron had signified to me in writing (Jan. 6) his absolute
desire that I should leave London on the earliest day that I could conveniently
fix.&nbsp; It was not safe for me to undertake the fatigue of a journey
sooner than the 15th.&nbsp; Previously to my departure, it had been
strongly impressed on my mind that Lord Byron was under the influence
of insanity.&nbsp; This opinion was derived in a great measure from
the communications made to me by his nearest relatives and personal
attendant, who had more opportunities than myself of observing him during
the latter part of my stay in town.&nbsp; It was even represented to
me that he was in danger of destroying himself.&nbsp; With the concurrence
of his family, I had consulted Dr. Baillie, as a friend (Jan. 8), respecting
this supposed malady.&nbsp; On acquainting him with the state of the
case, and with Lord Byron&rsquo;s desire that I should leave London,
Dr. Baillie thought that my absence might be advisable as an experiment,
assuming the fact of mental derangement; for Dr. Baillie, not having
had access to Lord Byron, could not pronounce a positive opinion on
that point.&nbsp; He enjoined that, in correspondence with Lord Byron,
I should avoid all but light and soothing topics.&nbsp; Under these
impressions I left London, determined to follow the advice given by
Dr. Baillie.&nbsp; Whatever might have been the nature of Lord Byron&rsquo;s
conduct towards me from the time of my marriage, yet, supposing him
to be in a state of mental alienation, it was not for me, nor for any
person of common humanity, to manifest at that moment a sense of injury.&nbsp;
On the day of my departure, and again on my arrival at Kirkby (Jan.
16), I wrote to Lord Byron in a kind and cheerful tone, according to
those medical directions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The last letter was circulated, and employed as a pretext
for the charge of my having been subsequently influenced to &ldquo;desert&rdquo;
<a name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72">{72}</a> my husband.&nbsp;
It has been argued that I parted from Lord Byron in perfect harmony;
that feelings incompatible with any deep sense of injury had dictated
the letter which I addressed to him; and that my sentiments must have
been changed by persuasion and interference when I was under the roof
of my parents.&nbsp; These assertions and inferences are wholly destitute
of foundation.&nbsp; When I arrived at Kirkby Mallory, my parents were
unacquainted with the existence of any causes likely to destroy my prospects
of happiness; and, when I communicated to them the opinion which had
been formed concerning Lord Byron&rsquo;s state of mind, they were most
anxious to promote his restoration by every means in their power.&nbsp;
They assured those relations who were with him in London, that &ldquo;they
would devote their whole care and attention to the alleviation of his
malady;&rdquo; and hoped to make the best arrangements for his comfort
if he could be induced to visit them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With these intentions, my mother wrote on the 17th to Lord
Byron, inviting him to Kirkby Mallory.&nbsp; She had always treated
him with an affectionate consideration and indulgence, which extended
to every little peculiarity of his feelings.&nbsp; Never did an irritating
word escape her lips in her whole intercourse with him.&nbsp; The accounts
given me after I left Lord Byron, by the persons in constant intercourse
with him, added to those doubts which had before transiently occurred
to my mind as to the reality of the alleged disease; and the reports
of his medical attendant were far from establishing the existence of
anything like lunacy.&nbsp; Under this uncertainty, I deemed it right
to communicate to my parents, that, if I were to consider Lord Byron&rsquo;s
past conduct as that of a person of sound mind, nothing could induce
me to return to him.&nbsp; It therefore appeared expedient, both to
them and myself, to consult the ablest advisers.&nbsp; For that object,
and also to obtain still further information respecting the appearances
which seemed to indicate mental derangement, my mother determined to
go to London.&nbsp; She was empowered by me to take legal opinions on
a written statement of mine, though I had then reasons for reserving
a part of the case from the knowledge even of my father and mother.&nbsp;
Being convinced by the result of these inquiries, and by the tenor of
Lord Byron&rsquo;s proceedings, that the notion of insanity was an illusion,
I no longer hesitated to authorise such measures as were necessary in
order to secure me from being ever again placed in his power.&nbsp;
Conformably with this resolution, my father wrote to him on the 2nd
of February to propose an amicable separation.&nbsp; Lord Byron at first
rejected this proposal; but when it was distinctly notified to him that,
if he persisted in his refusal, recourse must be had to legal measures,
he agreed to sign a deed of separation.&nbsp; Upon applying to Dr. Lushington,
who was intimately acquainted with all the circumstances, to state in
writing what he recollected upon this subject, I received from him the
following letter, by which it will be manifest that my mother cannot
have been actuated by any hostile or ungenerous motives towards Lord
Byron:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;MY DEAR LADY BYRON,&mdash;I can rely upon the accuracy
of my memory for the following statement.&nbsp; I was originally consulted
by Lady Noel, on your behalf, whilst you were in the country.&nbsp;
The circumstances detailed by her were such as justified a separation;
but they were not of that aggravated description as to render such a
measure indispensable.&nbsp; On Lady Noel&rsquo;s representation, I
deemed a reconciliation with Lord Byron practicable, and felt most sincerely
a wish to aid in effecting it.&nbsp; There was not on Lady Noel&rsquo;s
part any exaggeration of the facts; nor, so far as I could perceive,
any determination to prevent a return to Lord Byron: certainly none
was expressed when I spoke of a reconciliation.&nbsp; When you came
to town, in about a fortnight, or perhaps more, after my first interview
with Lady Noel, I was for the first time informed by you of facts utterly
unknown, as I have no doubt, to Sir Ralph and Lady Noel.&nbsp; On receiving
this additional information, my opinion was entirely changed: I considered
a reconciliation impossible.&nbsp; I declared my opinion, and added,
that, if such an idea should be entertained, I could not, either professionally
or otherwise, take any part towards effecting it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;&ldquo;Believe
me, very faithfully yours,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;&ldquo;STEPH.
LUSHINGTON.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Great George Street, Jan. 31, 1830.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have only to observe, that, if the statements on which my
legal advisers (the late Sir Samuel Romilly and Dr. Lushington) formed
their opinions were false, the responsibility and the odium should rest
with me only.&nbsp; I trust that the facts which I have here briefly
recapitulated will absolve my father and mother from all accusations
with regard to the part they took in the separation between Lord Byron
and myself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They neither originated, instigated, nor advised that separation;
and they cannot be condemned for having afforded to their daughter the
assistance and protection which she claimed.&nbsp; There is no other
near relative to vindicate their memory from insult.&nbsp; I am therefore
compelled to break the silence which I had hoped always to observe,
and to solicit from the readers of Lord Byron&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life&rdquo;
an impartial consideration of the testimony extorted from me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;A.
I. NOEL BYRON.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hanger Hill, Feb. 19, 1830.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The effect of this statement on the literary world may be best judged
by the discussion of it by Christopher North (Wilson) in the succeeding
May number of &lsquo;The Noctes,&rsquo; where the bravest and most generous
of literary men that then were&mdash;himself the husband of a gentle
wife&mdash;thus gives sentence: the conversation is between North and
the Shepherd:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>North.&mdash;&lsquo;God forbid I should wound the feelings
of Lady Byron, of whose character, known to me but by the high estimation
in which it is held by all who have enjoyed her friendship, I have always
spoken with respect! . . .&nbsp; But may I, without harshness or indelicacy,
say, here among ourselves, James, that, by marrying Byron, she took
upon herself, with eyes wide open and conscience clearly convinced,
duties very different from those of which, even in common cases, the
presaging foresight shadows. . . the light of the first nuptial moon?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Shepherd.&mdash;&lsquo;She did that, sir; by my troth, she did that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.</p>
<p>North.&mdash;&lsquo;Miss Milbanke knew that he was reckoned a rake
and a rou&eacute;; and although his genius wiped off, by impassioned
eloquence in love-letters that were felt to be irresistible, or hid
the worst stain of, that reproach, still Miss Milbanke must have believed
it a perilous thing to be the wife of Lord Byron. . . .&nbsp; But still,
by joining her life to his in marriage, she pledged her troth and her
faith and her love, under probabilities of severe, disturbing, perhaps
fearful trials, in the future. . . .</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I think Lady Byron ought not to have printed that Narrative.&nbsp;
Death abrogates not the rights of a husband to his wife&rsquo;s silence
when speech is fatal. . . to his character as a man.&nbsp; Has she not
flung suspicion over his bones interred, that they are the bones of
a&mdash;monster? . . .&nbsp; If Byron&rsquo;s sins or crimes&mdash;for
we are driven to use terrible terms&mdash;were unendurable and unforgivable
as if against the Holy Ghost, ought the wheel, the rack, or the stake
to have extorted that confession from his widow&rsquo;s breast? . .
.&nbsp; But there was no such pain here, James: the declaration was
voluntary, and it was calm.&nbsp; Self-collected, and gathering up all
her faculties and feelings into unshrinking strength, she denounced
before all the world&mdash;and throughout all space and all time&mdash;her
husband, as excommunicated by his vices from woman&rsquo;s bosom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Twas to vindicate the character of her parents that
Lady Byron wrote,&mdash;a holy purpose and devout, nor do I doubt sincere.&nbsp;
But filial affection and reverence, sacred as they are, may be blamelessly,
nay, righteously, subordinate to conjugal duties, which die not with
the dead, are extinguished not even by the sins of the dead, were they
as foul as the grave&rsquo;s corruption.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is what John Stuart Mill calls the literature of slavery for
woman, in length and breadth; and, that all women may understand the
doctrine, the Shepherd now takes up his parable, and expounds the true
position of the wife.&nbsp; We render his Scotch into English:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Not a few such widows do I know, whom brutal,
profligate, and savage husbands have brought to the brink of the grave,&mdash;as
good, as bright, as innocent as, and far more forgiving than, Lady Byron.&nbsp;
There they sit in their obscure, rarely-visited dwellings; for sympathy
instructed by suffering knows well that the deepest and most hopeless
misery is least given to complaint.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then follows a pathetic picture of one such widow, trembling and
fainting for hunger, obliged, on her way to the well for a can of water,
her only drink, to sit down on a &lsquo;<i>knowe</i>&rsquo; and say
a prayer.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Yet she&rsquo;s decently, yea, tidily dressed,
poor creature! in sair worn widow&rsquo;s clothes, a single suit for
Saturday and Sunday; her hair, untimely gray, is neatly braided under
her crape cap; and sometimes, when all is still and solitary in the
fields, and all labour has disappeared into the house, you may see her
stealing by herself, or leading one wee orphan by the hand, with another
at her breast, to the kirkyard, where the love of her youth and the
husband of her prime is buried.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet,&rsquo; says the Shepherd, &lsquo;he was a brute, a ruffian,
a monster.&nbsp; When drunk, how he raged and cursed and swore!&nbsp;
Often did she dread that, in his fits of inhuman passion, he would have
murdered the baby at her breast; for she had seen him dash their only
little boy, a child of eight years old, on the floor, till the blood
gushed from his ears; and then the madman threw himself down on the
body, and howled for the gallows.&nbsp; Limmers haunted his door, and
he theirs; and it was hers to lie, not sleep, in a cold, forsaken bed,
once the bed of peace, affection, and perfect happiness.&nbsp; Often
he struck her; and once when she was pregnant with that very orphan
now smiling on her breast, reaching out his wee fingers to touch the
flowers on his father&rsquo;s grave. . . .</p>
<p>&lsquo;But she tries to smile among the neighbours, and speaks of
her boy&rsquo;s likeness to its father; nor, when the conversation turns
on bygone times, does she fear to let his name escape her white lips,
&ldquo;My Robert; the bairn&rsquo;s not ill-favoured, but he will never
look like his father,&rdquo;&mdash;and such sayings, uttered in a calm,
sweet voice.&nbsp; Nay, I remember once how her pale countenance reddened
with a sudden flush of pride, when a gossiping crone alluded to their
wedding; and the widow&rsquo;s eye brightened through her tears to hear
how the bridegroom, sitting that sabbath in his front seat beside his
bonny bride, had not his equal for strength, stature, and all that is
beauty in man, in all the congregation.&nbsp; That, I say, sir, whether
right or wrong, was&mdash;forgiveness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a specimen of how even generous men had been so perverted
by the enchantment of Lord Byron&rsquo;s genius, as to turn all the
pathos and power of the strongest literature of that day against the
persecuted, pure woman, and for the strong, wicked man.&nbsp; These
&lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; writers knew, by Byron&rsquo;s own filthy, ghastly
writings, which had gone sorely against their own moral stomachs, that
he was foul to the bone.&nbsp; They could see, in Moore&rsquo;s &lsquo;Memoirs&rsquo;
right before them, how he had caught an innocent girl&rsquo;s heart
by sending a love-letter, and offer of marriage, at the end of a long
friendly correspondence,&mdash;a letter that had been written to <i>show</i>
to his libertine set, and sent on the toss-up of a copper, because he
cared nothing for it one way or the other.</p>
<p>They admit that, having won this poor girl, he had been savage, brutal,
drunken, cruel.&nbsp; They had read the filthy taunts in &lsquo;Don
Juan,&rsquo; and the nameless abominations in the &lsquo;Autobiography.&rsquo;&nbsp;
They had admitted among themselves that his honour was lost; but still
this abused, desecrated woman must <i>reverence</i> her brutal master&rsquo;s
memory, and not speak, even to defend the grave of her own kind father
and mother.</p>
<p>That there was <i>no</i> lover of her youth, that the marriage-vow
had been a hideous, shameless cheat, is on the face of Moore&rsquo;s
account; yet the &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; does not see it nor feel it,
and brings up against Lady Byron this touching story of a poor widow,
who really had had a true lover once,&mdash;a lover maddened, imbruted,
lost, through that very drunkenness in which the Noctes Club were always
glorying.</p>
<p>It is because of such transgressors as Byron, such supporters as
Moore and the Noctes Club, that there are so many helpless, cowering,
broken-hearted, abject women, given over to the animal love which they
share alike with the poor dog,&mdash;the dog, who, beaten, kicked, starved,
and cuffed, still lies by his drunken master with great anxious eyes
of love and sorrow, and with sweet, brute forgiveness nestles upon his
bosom, as he lies in his filth in the snowy ditch, to keep the warmth
of life in him.&nbsp; Great is the mystery of this fidelity in the poor,
loving brute,&mdash;most mournful and most sacred</p>
<p>But, oh that a noble man should have no higher ideal of the love
of a high-souled, heroic woman!&nbsp; Oh that men should teach women
that they owe no higher duties, and are capable of no higher tenderness,
than this loving, unquestioning animal fidelity!&nbsp; The dog is ever-loving,
ever-forgiving, because God has given him no high range of moral faculties,
no sense of justice, no consequent horror at impurity and vileness.</p>
<p>Much of the beautiful patience and forgiveness of women is made possible
to them by that utter <i>deadness to the sense of justice</i> which
the laws, literature, and misunderstood religion of England have sought
to induce in woman as a special grace and virtue.</p>
<p>The lesson to woman in this pathetic piece of special pleading is,
that man may sink himself below the brute, may wallow in filth like
the swine, may turn his home into a hell, beat and torture his children,
forsake the marriage-bed for foul rivals; yet all this does <i>not</i>
dissolve the marriage-vow on her part, nor free his bounden serf from
her obligation to honour his memory,&mdash;nay, to sacrifice to it the
honour due to a kind father and mother, slandered in their silent graves.</p>
<p>Such was the sympathy, and such the advice, that the best literature
of England could give to a young widow, a peeress of England, whose
husband, as they verily believed and admitted, might have done <i>worse</i>
than all this; whose crimes might have been &lsquo;foul, monstrous,
unforgivable as the sin against the Holy Ghost.&rsquo;&nbsp; If these
things be done in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?&nbsp;
If the peeress as <i>a wife</i> has no rights, what is the state of
the cotter&rsquo;s wife?</p>
<p>But, in the same paper, North again blames Lady Byron for not having
come out with the whole story before the world at the time she separated
from her husband.&nbsp; He says of the time when she first consulted
counsel through her mother, keeping back one item,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;How weak, and worse than weak, at such a juncture,
on which hung her whole fate, to ask legal advice on an imperfect document!&nbsp;
Give the delicacy of a virtuous woman its due; but at such a crisis,
when the question was whether her conscience was to be free from the
oath of oaths, delicacy should have died, and nature was privileged
to show unashamed&mdash;if such there were&mdash;the records of uttermost
pollution.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Shepherd.&mdash;&lsquo;And what think ye, sir, that a&rsquo; this
pollution could hae been, that sae electrified Dr. Lushington?&rsquo;</p>
<p>North.&mdash;&lsquo;Bad&mdash;bad&mdash;bad, James.&nbsp; Nameless,
it is horrible; named, it might leave Byron&rsquo;s memory yet within
the range of pity and forgiveness; and, where they are, their sister
affections will not be far; though, like weeping seraphs, standing aloof,
and veiling their wings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Shepherd.&mdash;&lsquo;She should indeed hae been silent&mdash;till
the grave had closed on her sorrows as on his sins.&rsquo;</p>
<p>North.&mdash;&lsquo;Even now she should speak,&mdash;or some one
else for her,&mdash; . . . and a few words will suffice.&nbsp; Worse
the condition of the dead man&rsquo;s name cannot be&mdash;far, far
better it might&mdash;I believe it would be&mdash;were all the truth
somehow or other declared; and declared it must be, not for Byron&rsquo;s
sake only, but for the sake of humanity itself; and then a mitigated
sentence, or eternal silence.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have another discussion of Lady Byron&rsquo;s duties in a further
number of &lsquo;Blackwood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Memoir&rsquo; being out, it was proposed that there should
be a complete annotation of Byron&rsquo;s works gotten up, and adorned,
for the further glorification of his memory, with portraits of the various
women whom he had delighted to honour.</p>
<p>Murray applied to Lady Byron for her portrait, and was met with a
cold, decided negative.&nbsp; After reading all the particulars of Byron&rsquo;s
harem of mistresses, and Moore&rsquo;s comparisons between herself and
La Guiccioli, one might <i>imagine</i> reasons why a lady, with proper
self-respect, should object to appearing in this manner.&nbsp; One would
suppose there might have been gentlemen who could well appreciate the
<i>motive</i> of that refusal; but it was only considered a new evidence
that she was indifferent to her conjugal duties, and wanting in that
<i>respect</i> which Christopher North had told her she owed a husband&rsquo;s
memory, though his crimes were foul as the rottenness of the grave.</p>
<p>Never, since Queen Vashti refused to come at the command of a drunken
husband to show herself to his drunken lords, was there a clearer case
of disrespect to the marital dignity on the part of a wife.&nbsp; It
was a plain act of insubordination, rebellion against law and order;
and how shocking in Lady Byron, who ought to feel herself but too much
flattered to be exhibited to the public as the head wife of a man of
genius!</p>
<p>Means were at once adopted to subdue her contumacy, of which one
may read in a note to the &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; (Noctes), September
1832.&nbsp; An artist was sent down to Ealing to take her picture by
stealth as she sat in church.&nbsp; Two sittings were thus obtained
without her knowledge.&nbsp; In the third one, the artist placed himself
boldly before her, and sketched, so that she could not but observe him.&nbsp;
We shall give the rest in Mackenzie&rsquo;s own words, as a remarkable
specimen of the obtuseness, not to say indelicacy of feeling, which
seemed to pervade the literary circles of England at the time:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;After prayers, Wright and his friend (the artist)
were visited by an ambassador from her ladyship to inquire the meaning
of what she had seen.&nbsp; The reply was, that Mr. Murray must have
her portrait, and was compelled to take what she refused to give.&nbsp;
The result was, Wright was requested to visit her, which he did; taking
with him, not the sketch, which was very good, but another, in which
there was a strong touch of caricature.&nbsp; Rather than allow that
to appear as her likeness (a very natural and womanly feeling by the
way), she consented to sit for the portrait to W. J. Newton, which was
engraved, and is here alluded to.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The artless barbarism of this note is too good to be lost; but it
is quite borne out by the conversation in the Noctes Club, which it
illustrates.</p>
<p>It would appear from this conversation that these Byron beauties
appeared successively in pamphlet form; and the picture of Lady Byron
is thus discussed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Mullion.&mdash;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know if you have
seen the last brochure.&nbsp; It has a charming head of Lady Byron,
who, it seems, sat on purpose: and that&rsquo;s very agreeable to hear
of; for it shows her ladyship has got over any little soreness that
Moore&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life&rdquo; occasioned, and is now willing to contribute
anything in her power to the real monument of Byron&rsquo;s genius.&rsquo;</p>
<p>North.&mdash;&lsquo;I am delighted to hear of this: &rsquo;tis really
very noble in the unfortunate lady.&nbsp; I never saw her.&nbsp; Is
the face a striking one?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mullion.&mdash;&lsquo;Eminently so,&mdash;a most calm, pensive, melancholy
style of native beauty,&mdash;and a most touching contrast to the maids
of Athens, Annesley, and all the rest of them.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure
you&rsquo;ll have the proof Finden has sent you framed for the Boudoir
at the Lodge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>North.&mdash;&lsquo;By all means.&nbsp; I mean to do that for all
the Byron Beauties.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it may be asked, Was there not a man in all England with delicacy
enough to feel for Lady Byron, and chivalry enough to speak a bold word
for her?&nbsp; Yes: there was one.&nbsp; Thomas Campbell the poet, when
he read Lady Byron&rsquo;s statement, believed it, as did Christopher
North; but it affected him differently.&nbsp; It appears he did not
believe it a wife&rsquo;s duty to burn herself on her husband&rsquo;s
funeral-pile, as did Christopher North; and held the singular idea,
that a wife had some rights as a human being as well as a husband.</p>
<p>Lady Byron&rsquo;s own statement appeared in pamphlet form in 1830:
at least, such is the date at the foot of the document.&nbsp; Thomas
Campbell, in &lsquo;The New Monthly Magazine,&rsquo; shortly after,
printed a spirited, gentlemanly defence of Lady Byron, and administered
a pointed rebuke to Moore for the rudeness and indelicacy he had shown
in selecting from Byron&rsquo;s letters the coarsest against herself,
her parents, and her old governess Mrs. Clermont, and by the indecent
comparisons he had instituted between Lady Byron and Lord Byron&rsquo;s
last mistress.</p>
<p>It is refreshing to hear, at last, from somebody who is not altogether
on his knees at the feet of the popular idol, and who has some chivalry
for woman, and some idea of common humanity.&nbsp; He says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I found my right to speak on this painful subject
on its now irrevocable publicity, brought up afresh as it has been by
Mr. Moore, to be the theme of discourse to millions, and, if I err not
much, the cause of misconception to innumerable minds.&nbsp; I claim
to speak of Lady Byron in the right of a man, and of a friend to the
rights of woman, and to liberty, and to natural religion.&nbsp; I claim
a right, more especially, as one of the many friends of Lady Byron,
who, one and all, feel aggrieved by this production.&nbsp; It has virtually
dragged her forward from the shade of retirement, where she had hid
her sorrows, and compelled her to defend the heads of her friends and
her parents from being crushed under the tombstone of Byron.&nbsp; Nay,
in a general view, it has forced her to defend herself; though, with
her true sense and her pure taste, she stands above all special pleading.&nbsp;
To plenary explanation she ought not&mdash;she never shall be driven.&nbsp;
Mr. Moore is too much a gentleman not to shudder at the thought of that;
but if other Byronists, of a far different stamp, were to force the
savage ordeal, it is her enemies, and not she, that would have to dread
the burning ploughshares.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We, her friends, have no wish to prolong the discussion: but
a few words we must add, even to her admirable statement; for hers is
a cause not only dear to her friends, but having become, from Mr. Moore
and her misfortunes, a publicly-agitated cause, it concerns morality,
and the most sacred rights of the sex, that she should (and that, too,
without more special explanations) be acquitted out and out, and honourably
acquitted, in this business, of all share in the blame, which is one
and indivisible.&nbsp; Mr. Moore, on further reflection, may see this;
and his return to candour will surprise us less than his momentary deviation
from its path.</p>
<p>&lsquo;For the tact of Mr. Moore&rsquo;s conduct in this affair,
I have not to answer; but, if indelicacy be charged upon me, I scorn
the charge.&nbsp; Neither will I submit to be called Lord Byron&rsquo;s
accuser; because a word against him I wish not to say beyond what is
painfully wrung from me by the necessity of owning or illustrating Lady
Byron&rsquo;s unblamableness, and of repelling certain misconceptions
respecting her, which are now walking the fashionable world, and which
have been fostered (though Heaven knows where they were born) most delicately
and warily by the Christian godfathership of Mr. Moore.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I write not at Lady Byron&rsquo;s bidding.&nbsp; I have never
humiliated either her or myself by asking if I should write, or what
I should write; that is to say, I never applied to her for information
against Lord Byron, though I was justified, as one intending to criticise
Mr. Moore, in inquiring into the truth of some of his statements.&nbsp;
Neither will I suffer myself to be called her champion, if by that word
be meant the advocate of her mere legal innocence; for that, I take
it, nobody questions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still less is it from the sorry impulse of pity that I speak
of this noble woman; for I look with wonder and even envy at the proud
purity of her sense and conscience, that have carried her exquisite
sensibilities in triumph through such poignant tribulations.&nbsp; But
I am proud to be called her friend, the humble illustrator of her cause,
and the advocate of those principles which make it to me more interesting
than Lord Byron&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Lady Byron (if the subject must be discussed)
belongs to sentiment and morality (at least as much as Lord Byron);
nor is she to be suffered, when compelled to speak, to raise her voice
as in a desert, with no friendly voice to respond to her.&nbsp; Lady
Byron could not have outlived her sufferings if she had not wound up
her fortitude to the high point of trusting mainly for consolation,
not to the opinion of the world, but to her own inward peace; and, having
said what ought to convince the world, I verily believe that she has
less care about the fashionable opinion respecting her than any of her
friends can have.&nbsp; But we, her friends, mix with the world; and
we hear offensive absurdities about her, which we have a right to put
down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I proceed to deal more generally with Mr. Moore&rsquo;s book.&nbsp;
You speak, Mr. Moore, against Lord Byron&rsquo;s censurers in a tone
of indignation which is perfectly lawful towards calumnious traducers,
but which will not terrify me, or any other man of courage who is no
calumniator, from uttering his mind freely with regard to this part
of your hero&rsquo;s conduct.&nbsp; I question your philosophy in assuming
that all that is noble in Byron&rsquo;s poetry was inconsistent with
the possibility of his being devoted to a pure and good woman; and I
repudiate your morality for canting too complacently about &ldquo;the
lava of his imagination,&rdquo; and the unsettled fever of his passions,
being any excuses for his planting the tic douloureux of domestic suffering
in a meek woman&rsquo;s bosom.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These are hard words, Mr. Moore; but you have brought them
on yourself by your voluntary ignorance of facts known to me; for you
might and ought to have known both sides of the question; and, if the
subject was too delicate for you to consult Lady Byron&rsquo;s confidential
friends, you ought to have had nothing to do with the subject.&nbsp;
But you cannot have submitted your book even to Lord Byron&rsquo;s sister,
otherwise she would have set you right about the imaginary spy, Mrs.
Clermont.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Campbell now goes on to print, at his own peril, he says, and without
time to ask leave, the following note from Lady Byron in reply to an
application he made to her, when he was about to review Moore&rsquo;s
book, for an &lsquo;estimate as to the correctness of Moore&rsquo;s
statements.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The following is Lady Byron&rsquo;s reply:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;DEAR MR. CAMPBELL,&mdash;In taking up my pen to
point out for your private information <a name="citation86"></a><a href="#footnote86">{86}</a>
those passages in Mr. Moore&rsquo;s representation of my part of the
story which were open to contradiction, I find them of still greater
extent than I had supposed; and to deny an assertion here and there
would virtually admit the truth of the rest.&nbsp; If, on the contrary,
I were to enter into a full exposure of the falsehood of the views taken
by Mr. Moore, I must detail various matters, which, consistently with
my principles and feelings, I cannot under the existing circumstances
disclose.&nbsp; I may, perhaps, convince you better of the difficulty
of the case by an example: It is not true that pecuniary embarrassments
were the cause of the disturbed state of Lord Byron&rsquo;s mind, or
formed the chief reason for the arrangements made by him at that time.&nbsp;
But is it reasonable for me to expect that you or any one else should
believe this, unless I show you what were the causes in question? and
this I cannot do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I
am, etc.,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;A.
I. NOEL BYRON.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Campbell then goes on to reprove Moore for his injustice to Mrs.
Clermont, whom Lord Byron had denounced as a spy, but whose respectability
and innocence were vouched for by Lord Byron&rsquo;s own family; and
then he pointedly rebukes one false statement of great indelicacy and
cruelty concerning Lady Byron&rsquo;s courtship, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;It is a further mistake on Mr. Moore&rsquo;s part,
and I can prove it to be so, if proof be necessary, to represent Lady
Byron, in the course of their courtship, as one inviting her future
husband to correspondence by letters after she had at first refused
him.&nbsp; She never proposed a correspondence.&nbsp; On the contrary,
he sent her a message after that first refusal, stating that he meant
to go abroad, and to travel for some years in the East; that he should
depart with a heart aching, but not angry; and that he only begged a
verbal assurance that she had still some interest in his happiness.&nbsp;
Could Miss Milbanke, as a well-bred woman, refuse a courteous answer
to such a message?&nbsp; She sent him a verbal answer, which was merely
kind and becoming, but which signified no encouragement that he should
renew his offer of marriage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;After that message, he wrote to her a most interesting letter
about himself,&mdash;about his views, personal, moral, and religious,&mdash;to
which it would have been uncharitable not to have replied.&nbsp; The
result was an insensibly increasing correspondence, which ended in her
being devotedly attached to him.&nbsp; About that time, I occasionally
saw Lord Byron; and though I knew less of him than Mr. Moore, yet I
suspect I knew as much of him as Miss Milbanke then knew.&nbsp; At that
time, he was so pleasing, that, if I had had a daughter with ample fortune
and beauty, I should have trusted her in marriage with Lord Byron.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Moore at that period evidently understood Lord Byron better
than either his future bride or myself; but this speaks more for Moore&rsquo;s
shrewdness than for Byron&rsquo;s ingenuousness of character.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is more for Lord Byron&rsquo;s sake than for his widow&rsquo;s
that I resort not to a more special examination of Mr. Moore&rsquo;s
misconceptions.&nbsp; The subject would lead me insensibly into hateful
disclosures against poor Lord Byron, who is more unfortunate in his
rash defenders than in his reluctant accusers.&nbsp; Happily, his own
candour turns our hostility from himself against his defenders.&nbsp;
It was only in wayward and bitter remarks that he misrepresented Lady
Byron.&nbsp; He would have defended himself irresistibly if Mr. Moore
had left only his acknowledging passages.&nbsp; But Mr. Moore has produced
a &ldquo;Life&rdquo; of him which reflects blame on Lady Byron so dexterously,
that &ldquo;more is meant than meets the ear.&rdquo;&nbsp; The almost
universal impression produced by his book is, that Lady Byron must be
a precise and a wan, unwarming spirit, a blue-stocking of chilblained
learning, a piece of insensitive goodness.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who that knows Lady Byron will not pronounce her to be everything
the reverse?&nbsp; Will it be believed that this person, so unsuitably
matched to her moody lord, has written verses that would do no discredit
to Byron himself; that her sensitiveness is surpassed and bounded only
by her good sense; and that she is</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Blest with a temper, whose unclouded ray<br />
Can make to-morrow cheerful as to-day&rdquo;?</p>
<p>&lsquo;She brought to Lord Byron beauty, manners, fortune, meekness,
romantic affection, and everything that ought to have made her to the
most transcendent man of genius&mdash;had he been what he should have
been&mdash;his pride and his idol.&nbsp; I speak not of Lady Byron in
the commonplace manner of attesting character: I appeal to the gifted
Mrs. Siddons and Joanna Baillie, to Lady Charlemont, and to other ornaments
of their sex, whether I am exaggerating in the least when I say, that,
in their whole lives, they have seen few beings so intellectual and
well-tempered as Lady Byron.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wish to be as ingenuous as possible in speaking of her.&nbsp;
Her manner, I have no hesitation to say, is cool at the first interview,
but is modestly, and not insolently, cool: she contracted it, I believe,
from being exposed by her beauty and large fortune, in youth, to numbers
of suitors, whom she could not have otherwise kept at a distance.&nbsp;
But this manner could have had no influence with Lord Byron; for it
vanishes on nearer acquaintance, and has no origin in coldness.&nbsp;
All her friends like her frankness the better for being preceded by
this reserve.&nbsp; This manner, however, though not the slightest apology
for Lord Byron, has been inimical to Lady Byron in her misfortunes.&nbsp;
It endears her to her friends; but it piques the indifferent.&nbsp;
Most odiously unjust, therefore, is Mr. Moore&rsquo;s assertion, that
she has had the advantage of Lord Byron in public opinion.&nbsp; She
is, comparatively speaking, unknown to the world; for though she has
many friends, that is, a friend in everyone who knows her, yet her pride
and purity and misfortunes naturally contract the circle of her acquaintance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is something exquisitely unjust in Mr. Moore comparing
her chance of popularity with Lord Byron&rsquo;s, the poet who can command
men of talents,&mdash;putting even Mr. Moore into the livery of his
service,&mdash;and who has suborned the favour of almost all women by
the beauty of his person and the voluptuousness of his verses.&nbsp;
Lady Byron has nothing to oppose to these fascinations but the truth
and justice of her cause.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You said, Mr. Moore, that Lady Byron was unsuitable to her
lord: the word is cunningly insidious, and may mean as much or as little
as may suit your convenience.&nbsp; But, if she was unsuitable, I remark
that it tells all the worse against Lord Byron.&nbsp; I have not read
it in your book (for I hate to wade through it); but they tell me that
you have not only warily depreciated Lady Byron, but that you have described
a lady that would have suited him.&nbsp; If this be true, &ldquo;it
is the unkindest cut of all,&rdquo;&mdash;to hold up a florid description
of a woman suitable to Lord Byron, as if in mockery over the forlorn
flower of virtue that was drooping in the solitude of sorrow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I trust there is no such passage in your book.&nbsp; Surely
you must be conscious of your woman, with her &lsquo;virtue loose about
her, who would have suited Lord Byron,&rdquo; to be as imaginary a being
as the woman without a head.&nbsp; A woman to suit Lord Byron!&nbsp;
Poo, poo!&nbsp; I could paint to you the woman that could have matched
him, if I had not bargained to say as little as possible against him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If Lady Byron was not suitable to Lord Byron, so much the
worse for his lordship; for let me tell you, Mr. Moore, that neither
your poetry, nor Lord Byron&rsquo;s, nor all our poetry put together,
ever delineated a more interesting being than the woman whom you have
so coldly treated.&nbsp; This was not kicking the dead lion, but wounding
the living lamb, who was already bleeding and shorn, even unto the quick.&nbsp;
I know, that, collectively speaking, the world is in Lady Byron&rsquo;s
favour; but it is coldly favourable, and you have not warmed its breath.&nbsp;
Time, however, cures everything; and even your book, Mr. Moore, may
be the means of Lady Byron&rsquo;s character being better appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;THOMAS
CAMPBELL.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is what seems to be a gentlemanly, high-spirited, chivalric
man, throwing down his glove in the lists for a pure woman.</p>
<p>What was the consequence?&nbsp; Campbell was crowded back, thrust
down, overwhelmed, his eyes filled with dust, his mouth with ashes.</p>
<p>There was a general confusion and outcry, which reacted both on him
and on Lady Byron.&nbsp; Her friends were angry with him for having
caused this re-action upon her; and he found himself at once attacked
by Lady Byron&rsquo;s enemies, and deserted by her friends.&nbsp; All
the literary authorities of his day took up against him with energy.&nbsp;
Christopher North, professor of moral philosophy in the Edinburgh University,
in a fatherly talk in &lsquo;The Noctes,&rsquo; condemns Campbell, and
justifies Moore, and heartily recommends his &lsquo;Biography,&rsquo;
as containing nothing materially objectionable on the score either of
manners or morals.&nbsp; Thus we have it in &lsquo;The Noctes&rsquo;
of May 1830:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Mr. Moore&rsquo;s biographical book I admired;
and I said so to my little world, in two somewhat lengthy articles,
which many approved, and some, I am sorry to know, condemned.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the point in question between Moore and Campbell, North goes on
to justify Moore altogether, only admitting that &lsquo;it would have
been better had he not printed any coarse expression of Byron&rsquo;s
about the old people;&rsquo; and, finally, he closes by saying,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I do not think that, under the circumstances,
Mr. Campbell himself, had he written Byron&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life,&rdquo;
could have spoken, with the sentiments he then held, in a better, more
manly, and more gentlemanly spirit, in so far as regards Lady Byron,
than Mr. Moore did: and I am sorry he has been deterred from &ldquo;swimming&rdquo;
through Mr. Moore&rsquo;s work by the fear of &ldquo;wading;&rdquo;
for the waters are clear and deep; nor is there any mud, either at the
bottom or round the margin.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the conduct of Lady Byron&rsquo;s so-called friends on this occasion
it is more difficult to speak.</p>
<p>There has always been in England, as John Stuart Mill says, a class
of women who glory in the utter self-abnegation of the wife to the husband,
as the special crown of womanhood.&nbsp; Their patron saint is the Griselda
of Chaucer, who, when her husband humiliates her, and treats her as
a brute, still accepts all with meek, unquestioning, uncomplaining devotion.&nbsp;
He tears her from her children; he treats her with personal abuse; he
repudiates her,&mdash;sends her out to nakedness and poverty; he installs
another mistress in his house, and sends for the first to be her handmaid
and his own: and all this the meek saint accepts in the words of Milton,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;My guide and head,<br />
What thou hast said is just and right.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Accordingly, Miss Martineau tells us that when Campbell&rsquo;s defence
came out, coupled with a note from Lady Byron,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The first obvious remark was, that there was no
real disclosure; and the whole affair had the appearance of a desire,
on the part of Lady Byron, to exculpate herself, while yet no adequate
information was given.&nbsp; Many, who had regarded her with favour
till then, gave her up so far as to believe that feminine weakness had
prevailed at last.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The saint had fallen from her pedestal! She had shown a human frailty!&nbsp;
Quite evidently she is not a Griselda, but possessed with a shocking
desire to exculpate herself and her friends.</p>
<p>Is it, then, only to slandered <i>men</i> that the privilege belongs
of desiring to exculpate themselves and their families and their friends
from unjust censure?</p>
<p>Lord Byron had made it a life-long object to vilify and defame his
wife.&nbsp; He had used for that one particular purpose every talent
that he possessed.&nbsp; He had left it as a last charge to Moore to
pursue the warfare after death, which Moore had done to some purpose;
and Christopher North had informed Lady Byron that her private affairs
were discussed, not only with the whisky-toddy of the Noctes Club, but
in every drawing-room in May Fair; and declared that the &lsquo;Dear
Duck&rsquo; letter, and various other matters, must be explained, and
urged somebody to speak; and then, when Campbell does speak with all
the energy of a real gentleman, a general outcry and an indiscriminate
<i>m&ecirc;l&eacute;e</i> is the result.</p>
<p>The world, with its usual injustice, insisted on attributing Campbell&rsquo;s
defence to Lady Byron.</p>
<p>The reasons for this seemed to be, first, that Campbell states that
he did <i>not</i> ask Lady Byron&rsquo;s leave, and that she did <i>not</i>
authorise him to defend her; and, second, that, having asked some explanations
from her, he prints a note in which she declines to give any.</p>
<p>We know not how a lady could more gently yet firmly decline to make
a gentleman her confidant than in this published note of Lady Byron;
and yet, to this day, Campbell is spoken of by the world as having been
Lady Byron&rsquo;s confidant at this time.&nbsp; This simply shows how
very trustworthy are the general assertions about Lady Byron&rsquo;s
confidants.</p>
<p>The final result of the matter, so far as Campbell was concerned,
is given in Miss Martineau&rsquo;s sketch, in the following paragraph:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The whole transaction was one of poor Campbell&rsquo;s
freaks.&nbsp; He excused himself by saying it was a mistake of his;
that he did not know what he was about when he published the paper.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the saddest of all sad things to see a man, who has spoken
from moral convictions, in advance of his day, and who has taken a stand
for which he ought to honour himself, thus forced down and humiliated,
made to doubt his own better nature and his own honourable feelings,
by the voice of a wicked world.</p>
<p>Campbell had no steadiness to stand by the truth he saw.&nbsp; His
whole story is told incidentally in a note to &lsquo;The Noctes,&rsquo;
in which it is stated, that in an article in &lsquo;Blackwood,&rsquo;
January 1825, on Scotch poets, the palm was given to Hogg over Campbell;
&lsquo;one ground being, that <i>he</i> could drink &ldquo;eight and
twenty tumblers of punch, while Campbell is hazy upon seven.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>There is evidence in &lsquo;The Noctes,&rsquo; that in due time Campbell
was reconciled to Moore, and was always suitably ashamed of having tried
to be any more generous or just than the men of his generation.</p>
<p>And so it was settled as a law to Jacob, and an ordinance in Israel,
that the Byron worship should proceed, and that all the earth should
keep silence before him.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don Juan,&rsquo; that, years before,
had been printed by stealth, without Murray&rsquo;s name on the title-page,
that had been denounced as a book which no woman should read, and had
been given up as a desperate enterprise, now came forth in triumph,
with banners flying and drums beating.&nbsp; Every great periodical
in England that had fired moral volleys of artillery against it in its
early days, now humbly marched in the glorious procession of admirers
to salute this edifying work of genius.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Blackwood,&rsquo; which in the beginning had been the most
indignantly virtuous of the whole, now grovelled and ate dust as the
serpent in the very abjectness of submission.&nbsp; Odoherty (Maginn)
declares that he would rather have written a page of &lsquo;Don Juan&rsquo;
than a ton of &lsquo;Childe Harold.&rsquo; <a name="citation95a"></a><a href="#footnote95a">{95a}</a>&nbsp;
Timothy Tickler informs Christopher North that he means to tender Murray,
as Emperor of the North, an interleaved copy <a name="citation95b"></a><a href="#footnote95b">{95b}</a>
of &lsquo;Don Juan,&rsquo; with illustrations, as the <i>only</i> work
of Byron&rsquo;s he cares much about; and Christopher North, professor
of <i>moral</i> philosophy in Edinburgh, smiles approval!&nbsp; We are
not, after this, surprised to see the assertion, by a recent much-aggrieved
writer in &lsquo;The London Era,&rsquo; that &lsquo;Lord Byron has been,
more than any other man of the age, the <i>teacher</i> of the <i>youth</i>
of England;&rsquo; and that he has &lsquo;seen his works on the bookshelves
of <i>bishops&rsquo;</i> palaces, no less than on the tables of university
undergraduates.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A note to &lsquo;The Noctes&rsquo; of July 1822 informs us of another
instance of Lord Byron&rsquo;s triumph over English morals:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The mention of this&rsquo; (Byron&rsquo;s going
to Greece) &lsquo;reminds me, by the by, of what the Guiccioli said
in her visit to London, where she was so lionised as having been the
lady-love of Byron.&nbsp; She was rather fond of speaking on the subject,
designating herself by some Venetian pet phrase, which she interpreted
as meaning &ldquo;Love-Wife.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What was Lady Byron to do in such a world?&nbsp; She retired to the
deepest privacy, and devoted herself to works of charity, and the education
of her only child, that brilliant daughter, to whose eager, opening
mind the whole course of current literature must bring so many trying
questions in regard to the position of her father and mother,&mdash;questions
that the mother might not answer.&nbsp; That the cruel inconsiderateness
of the literary world added thorns to the intricacies of the path trodden
by every mother who seeks to guide, restrain, and educate a strong,
acute, and precociously intelligent child, must easily be seen.</p>
<p>What remains to be said of Lady Byron&rsquo;s life shall be said
in the words of Miss Martineau, published in &lsquo;The Atlantic Monthly:&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Her life, thenceforth, was one of unremitting
bounty to society administered with as much skill and prudence as benevolence.&nbsp;
She lived in retirement, changing her abode frequently; partly for the
benefit of her child&rsquo;s education and the promotion of her benevolent
schemes, and partly from a restlessness which was one of the few signs
of injury received from the spoiling of associations with home.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She felt a satisfaction which her friends rejoiced in when
her daughter married Lord King, at present the Earl of Lovelace, in
1835; and when grief upon grief followed, in the appearance of mortal
disease in her only child, her quiet patience stood her in good stead
as before.&nbsp; She even found strength to appropriate the blessings
of the occasion, and took comfort, as did her dying daughter, in the
intimate friendship, which grew closer as the time of parting drew nigh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lady Lovelace died in 1852; and, for her few remaining years,
Lady Byron was devoted to her grandchildren.&nbsp; But nearer calls
never lessened her interest in remoter objects.&nbsp; Her mind was of
the large and clear quality which could comprehend remote interests
in their true proportions, and achieve each aim as perfectly as if it
were the only one.&nbsp; Her agents used to say that it was impossible
to mistake her directions; and thus her business was usually well done.&nbsp;
There was no room, in her case, for the ordinary doubts, censures, and
sneers about the misapplication of bounty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her taste did not lie in the &ldquo;Charity-Ball&rdquo; direction;
her funds were not lavished in encouraging hypocrisy and improvidence
among the idle and worthless; and the quality of her charity was, in
fact, as admirable as its quantity.&nbsp; Her chief aim was the extension
and improvement of popular education; but there was no kind of misery
that she heard of that she did not palliate to the utmost, and no kind
of solace that her quick imagination and sympathy could devise that
she did not administer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In her methods, she united consideration and frankness with
singular success.&nbsp; For one instance among a thousand: A lady with
whom she had had friendly relations some time before, and who became
impoverished in a quiet way by hopeless sickness, preferred poverty
with an easy conscience to a competency attended by some uncertainty
about the perfect rectitude of the resource.&nbsp; Lady Byron wrote
to an intermediate person exactly what she thought of the case.&nbsp;
Whether the judgment of the sufferer was right or mistaken was nobody&rsquo;s
business but her own: this was the first point.&nbsp; Next, a voluntary
poverty could never be pitied by anybody: that was the second.&nbsp;
But it was painful to others to think of the mortification to benevolent
feelings which attends poverty; and there could be no objection to arresting
that pain.&nbsp; Therefore she, Lady Byron, had lodged in a neighbouring
bank the sum of one hundred pounds, to be used for benevolent purposes;
and, in order to preclude all outside speculation, she had made the
money payable to the order of the intermediate person, so that the sufferer&rsquo;s
name need not appear at all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Five and thirty years of unremitting secret bounty like this
must make up a great amount of human happiness; but this was only one
of a wide variety of methods of doing good.&nbsp; It was the unconcealable
magnitude of her beneficence, and its wise quality, which made her a
second time the theme of English conversation in all honest households
within the four seas.&nbsp; Years ago, it was said far and wide that
Lady Byron was doing more good than anybody else in England; and it
was difficult to imagine how anybody could do more.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lord Byron spent every shilling that the law allowed him out
of her property while he lived, and left away from her every shilling
that he could deprive her of by his will; yet she had, eventually, a
large income at her command.&nbsp; In the management of it, she showed
the same wise consideration that marked all her practical decisions.&nbsp;
She resolved to spend her whole income, seeing how much the world needed
help at the moment.&nbsp; Her care was for the existing generation,
rather than for a future one, which would have its own friends.&nbsp;
She usually declined trammelling herself with annual subscriptions to
charities; preferring to keep her freedom from year to year, and to
achieve definite objects by liberal bounty, rather than to extend partial
help over a large surface which she could not herself superintend.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was her first industrial school that awakened the admiration
of the public, which had never ceased to take an interest in her, while
sorely misjudging her character.&nbsp; We hear much now&mdash;and everybody
hears it with pleasure&mdash;of the spread of education in &ldquo;common
things;&rdquo; but long before Miss Coutts inherited her wealth, long
before a name was found for such a method of training, Lady Byron had
instituted the thing, and put it in the way of making its own name.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was living at Ealing, in Middlesex, in 1834; and there
she opened one of the first industrial schools in England, if not the
very first.&nbsp; She sent out a master to Switzerland, to be instructed
in De Fellenburgh&rsquo;s method.&nbsp; She took, on lease, five acres
of land, and spent several hundred pounds in rendering the buildings
upon it fit for the purposes of the school.&nbsp; A liberal education
was afforded to the children of artisans and labourers during the half
of the day when they were not employed in the field or garden.&nbsp;
The allotments were rented by the boys, who raised and sold produce,
which afforded them a considerable yearly profit if they were good workmen.&nbsp;
Those who worked in the field earned wages; their labour being paid
by the hour, according to the capability of the young labourer.&nbsp;
They kept their accounts of expenditure and receipts, and acquired good
habits of business while learning the occupation of their lives.&nbsp;
Some mechanical trades were taught, as well as the arts of agriculture.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Part of the wisdom of the management lay in making the pupils
pay.&nbsp; Of one hundred pupils, half were boarders.&nbsp; They paid
little more than half the expenses of their maintenance, and the day-scholars
paid threepence per week.&nbsp; Of course, a large part of the expense
was borne by Lady Byron, besides the payments she made for children
who could not otherwise have entered the school.&nbsp; The establishment
flourished steadily till 1852, when the owner of the land required it
back for building purposes.&nbsp; During the eighteen years that the
Ealing schools were in action, they did a world of good in the way of
incitement and example.&nbsp; The poor-law commissioners pointed out
their merits.&nbsp; Land-owners and other wealthy persons visited them,
and went home and set up similar establishments.&nbsp; During those
years, too, Lady Byron had herself been at work in various directions
to the same purpose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A more extensive industrial scheme was instituted on her Leicestershire
property, and not far off she opened a girls&rsquo; school and an infant
school; and when a season of distress came, as such seasons are apt
to befall the poor Leicestershire stocking-weavers, Lady Byron fed the
children for months together, till they could resume their payments.&nbsp;
These schools were opened in 1840.&nbsp; The next year, she built a
schoolhouse on her Warwickshire property; and, five years later, she
set up an iron schoolhouse on another Leicestershire estate.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By this time, her educational efforts were costing her several
hundred pounds a year in the mere maintenance of existing establishments;
but this is the smallest consideration in the case.&nbsp; She has sent
out tribes of boys and girls into life fit to do their part there with
skill and credit and comfort.&nbsp; Perhaps it is a still more important
consideration, that scores of teachers and trainers have been led into
their vocation, and duly prepared for it, by what they saw and learned
in her schools.&nbsp; As for the best and the worst of the Ealing boys,
the best have, in a few cases, been received into the Battersea Training
School, whence they could enter on their career as teachers to the greatest
advantage; and the worst found their school a true reformatory, before
reformatory schools were heard of.&nbsp; At Bristol, she bought a house
for a reformatory for girls; and there her friend, Miss Carpenter, faithfully
and energetically carries out her own and Lady Byron&rsquo;s aims, which
were one and the same.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There would be no end if I were to catalogue the schemes of
which these are a specimen.&nbsp; It is of more consequence to observe
that her mind was never narrowed by her own acts, as the minds of benevolent
people are so apt to be.&nbsp; To the last, her interest in great political
movements, at home and abroad, was as vivid as ever.&nbsp; She watched
every step won in philosophy, every discovery in science, every token
of social change and progress in every shape.&nbsp; Her mind was as
liberal as her heart and hand.&nbsp; No diversity of opinion troubled
her: she was respectful to every sort of individuality, and indulgent
to all constitutional peculiarities.&nbsp; It must have puzzled those
who kept up the notion of her being &ldquo;strait-laced&rdquo; to see
how indulgent she was even to Epicurean tendencies,&mdash;the remotest
of all from her own.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I must stop; for I do not wish my honest memorial to degenerate
into panegyric.&nbsp; Among her latest known acts were her gifts to
the Sicilian cause, and her manifestations on behalf of the antislavery
cause in the United States.&nbsp; Her kindness to William and Ellen
Craft must be well known there; and it is also related in the newspapers,
that she bequeathed a legacy to a young American to assist him under
any disadvantages he might suffer as an abolitionist.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All these deeds were done under a heavy burden of ill health.&nbsp;
Before she had passed middle life, her lungs were believed to be irreparably
injured by partial ossification.&nbsp; She was subject to attacks so
serious, that each one, for many years, was expected to be the last.&nbsp;
She arranged her affairs in correspondence with her liabilities: so
that the same order would have been found, whether she died suddenly
or after long warning.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was to receive one more accession of outward greatness
before she departed.&nbsp; She became Baroness Wentworth in November,
1856.&nbsp; This is one of the facts of her history; but it is the least
interesting to us, as probably to her.&nbsp; We care more to know that
her last days were bright in honour, and cheered by the attachment of
old friends worthy to pay the duty she deserved.&nbsp; Above all, it
is consoling to know that she who so long outlived her only child was
blessed with the unremitting and tender care of her grand-daughter.&nbsp;
She died on the 16th of May, 1860.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The portrait of Lady Byron as she was at the time of her marriage
is probably remembered by some of my readers.&nbsp; It is very engaging.&nbsp;
Her countenance afterwards became much worn; but its expression of thoughtfulness
and composure was very interesting.&nbsp; Her handwriting accorded well
with the character of her mind.&nbsp; It was clear, elegant, and womanly.&nbsp;
Her manners differed with circumstances.&nbsp; Her shrinking sensitiveness
might embarrass one visitor; while another would be charmed with her
easy, significant, and vivacious conversation.&nbsp; It depended much
on whom she talked with.&nbsp; The abiding certainty was, that she had
strength for the hardest of human trials, and the composure which belongs
to strength.&nbsp; For the rest, it is enough to point to her deeds,
and to the mourning of her friends round the chasm which her departure
has made in their life, and in the society in which it is spent.&nbsp;
All that could be done in the way of personal love and honour was done
while she lived: it only remains now to see that her name and fame are
permitted to shine forth at last in their proper light.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have simply to ask the reader whether a life like this was not
the best, the noblest answer that a woman could make to a doubting world.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V.&nbsp; THE ATTACK ON LADY BYRON&rsquo;S GRAVE.</h3>
<p>We have now brought the review of the antagonism against Lady Byron
down to the period of her death.&nbsp; During all this time, let the
candid reader ask himself which of these two parties seems to be plotting
against the other.</p>
<p><i>Which</i> has been active, aggressive, unscrupulous? which has
been silent, quiet, unoffending?&nbsp; Which of the two has laboured
to make a party, and to make that party active, watchful, enthusiastic?</p>
<p>Have we not proved that Lady Byron remained perfectly silent during
Lord Byron&rsquo;s life, patiently looking out from her retirement to
see the waves of popular sympathy, that once bore her up, day by day
retreating, while his accusations against her were resounding in his
poems over the whole earth?&nbsp; And after Lord Byron&rsquo;s death,
when all the world with one consent began to give their memorials of
him, and made it appear, by their various &lsquo;recollections of conversations,&rsquo;
how incessantly he had obtruded his own version of the separation upon
every listener, did she manifest any similar eagerness?</p>
<p>Lady Byron had seen the &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; coming forward, on
the first appearance of &lsquo;Don Juan,&rsquo; to rebuke the cowardly
lampoon in words eloquent with all the unperverted vigour of an honest
Englishman.&nbsp; Under the power of the great conspirator, she had
seen <i>that</i> &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; become the very eager recipient
and chief reporter of the stories against her, and the blind admirer
of her adversary.</p>
<p>All this time, she lost sympathy daily by being silent.&nbsp; The
world will embrace those who court it; it will patronise those who seek
its favour; it will make parties for those who seek to make parties:
but for the often accused who do not speak, who make no confidants and
no parties, the world soon loses sympathy.</p>
<p>When at last she spoke, Christopher North says <i>&lsquo;she astonished
the world</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; Calm, clear, courageous, exact as to time,
date, and circumstance, was that first testimony, backed by the equally
clear testimony of Dr. Lushington.</p>
<p>It showed that her secret had been kept even from her parents.&nbsp;
In words precise, firm, and fearless, she says, &lsquo;If these statements
on which Dr. Lushington and Sir Samuel Romilly formed their opinion
were false, the responsibility and the odium should rest with me only.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Christopher North did not pretend to disbelieve this statement.&nbsp;
He breathed not a doubt of Lady Byron&rsquo;s word.&nbsp; He spoke of
the crime indicated, as one which might have been foul as the grave&rsquo;s
corruption, unforgivable as the sin against the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; He
rebuked the wife for bearing this testimony, even to save the memory
of her dead father and mother, and, in the same breath, declared that
she ought now to go farther, and speak fully the one awful word, and
then&mdash;&lsquo;a mitigated sentence, or eternal silence!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But Lady Byron took no counsel with the world, nor with the literary
men of her age.&nbsp; One knight, with some small remnant of England&rsquo;s
old chivalry, set lance in rest for her: she saw him beaten back unhorsed,
rolled in the dust, and ingloriously vanquished, and perceived that
henceforth nothing but injury could come to any one who attempted to
speak for her.</p>
<p>She turned from the judgments of man and the fond and natural hopes
of human nature, to lose herself in sacred ministries to the downcast
and suffering.&nbsp; What nobler record for woman could there be than
that which Miss Martineau has given?</p>
<p>Particularly to be noted in Lady Byron was her peculiar interest
in reclaiming fallen women.&nbsp; Among her letters to Mrs. Prof. Follen,
of Cambridge, was one addressed to a society of ladies who had undertaken
this difficult work.&nbsp; It was full of heavenly wisdom and of a large
and tolerant charity.&nbsp; F&eacute;nelon truly says, it is only perfection
that can tolerate imperfection; and the very purity of Lady Byron&rsquo;s
nature made her most forbearing and most tender towards the weak and
the guilty.&nbsp; This letter, with all the rest of Lady Byron&rsquo;s,
was returned to the hands of her executors after her death.&nbsp; Its
publication would greatly assist the world in understanding the peculiarities
of its writer&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p>Lady Byron passed to a higher life in 1860. <a name="citation105"></a><a href="#footnote105">{105}</a>&nbsp;
After her death, I looked for the publication of her Memoir and Letters
as the event that should give her the same opportunity of being known
and judged by her life and writings that had been so freely accorded
to Lord Byron.</p>
<p>She was, in her husband&rsquo;s estimation, a woman of genius.&nbsp;
She was the friend of many of the first men and women of her times,
and corresponded with them on topics of literature, morals, religion,
and, above all, on the benevolent and philanthropic movements of the
day, whose principles she had studied with acute observation, and in
connection with which she had acquired a large experience.</p>
<p>The knowledge of her, necessarily diffused by such a series of letters,
would have created in America a comprehension of her character, of itself
sufficient to wither a thousand slanders.</p>
<p>Such a Memoir was contemplated.&nbsp; Lady Byron&rsquo;s letters
to Mrs. Follen were asked for from Boston; and I was applied to by a
person in England, who I have recently learned is one of the existing
trustees of Lady Byron&rsquo;s papers, to furnish copies of her letters
to me for the purpose of a Memoir.&nbsp; Before I had time to have copies
made, another letter came, stating that the trustees had concluded that
it was best not to publish any Memoir of Lady Byron at all.</p>
<p>This left the character of Lady Byron in our American world precisely
where the slanders of her husband, the literature of the Noctes Club,
and the unanimous verdict of May Fair as recorded by &lsquo;Blackwood,&rsquo;
had placed it.</p>
<p>True, Lady Byron had nobly and quietly lived down these slanders
in England by deeds that made her name revered as a saint among all
those who valued saintliness.</p>
<p>But in France and Italy, and in these United States, I have had abundant
opportunity to know that Lady Byron stood judged and condemned on the
testimony of her brilliant husband, and that the feeling against her
had a vivacity and intensity not to be overcome by mere allusions to
a virtuous life in distant England.</p>
<p>This is strikingly shown by one fact.&nbsp; In the American edition
of Moore&rsquo;s &lsquo;Life of Byron,&rsquo; by Claxton, Remsen, and
Haffelfinger, Philadelphia, 1869, which I have been consulting, Lady
Byron&rsquo;s statement, which is found in the Appendix of Murray&rsquo;s
standard edition, <i>is</i> <i>entirely omitted</i>.&nbsp; Every other
paper is carefully preserved.&nbsp; This one incident showed how the
tide of sympathy was setting in this New World.&nbsp; Of course, there
is no stronger power than a virtuous life; but, for a virtuous life
to bear testimony to the world, its details must be <i>told</i>, so
that the world may know them.</p>
<p>Suppose the memoirs of Clarkson and Wilberforce had been suppressed
after their death, how soon might the coming tide have wiped out the
record of their bravery and philanthropy!&nbsp; Suppose the lives of
Francis Xavier and Henry Martyn had never been written, and we had lost
the remembrance of what holy men could do and dare in the divine enthusiasm
of Christian faith!&nbsp; Suppose we had no F&eacute;nelon, no Book
of Martyrs!</p>
<p>Would there not be an outcry through all the literary and artistic
world if a perfect statue were allowed to remain buried for ever because
some painful individual history was connected with its burial and its
recovery?&nbsp; But is not a noble life a greater treasure to mankind
than any work of art?</p>
<p>We have heard much mourning over the burned Autobiography of Lord
Byron, and seen it treated of in a magazine as &lsquo;the lost chapter
in history.&rsquo;&nbsp; The lost chapter in history is <i>Lady</i>
Byron&rsquo;s Autobiography in her life and letters; and the suppression
of them is the root of this whole mischief.</p>
<p>We do not in this intend to censure the parties who came to this
decision.</p>
<p>The descendants of Lady Byron revere her memory, as they have every
reason to do.&nbsp; That it was <i>their</i> desire to have a Memoir
of her published, I have been informed by an individual of the highest
character in England, who obtained the information directly from Lady
Byron&rsquo;s grandchildren.</p>
<p>But the trustees in whose care the papers were placed drew back on
examination of them, and declared, that, as Lady Byron&rsquo;s papers
could not be fully published, they should regret anything that should
call public attention once more to the discussion of her history.</p>
<p>Reviewing this long history of the way in which the literary world
had treated Lady Byron, we cannot wonder that her friends should have
doubted whether there was left on earth any justice, or sense that anything
is due to woman as a human being with human rights.&nbsp; Evidently
this lesson had taken from them all faith in the moral sense of the
world.&nbsp; Rather than re-awaken the discussion, so unsparing, so
painful, and so indelicate, which had been carried on so many years
around that loved form, now sanctified by death, they sacrificed the
dear pleasure of the memorials, and the interests of mankind, who have
an indefeasible right to all the help that can be got from the truth
of history as to the living power of virtue, and the reality of that
great victory that overcometh the world.</p>
<p>There are thousands of poor victims suffering in sadness, discouragement,
and poverty; heart-broken wives of brutal, drunken husbands; women enduring
nameless wrongs and horrors which the delicacy of their sex forbids
them to utter,&mdash;to whom the lovely letters lying hidden away under
those seals might bring courage and hope from springs not of this world.</p>
<p>But though the friends of Lady Byron, perhaps from despair of their
kind, from weariness of the utter injustice done her, wished to cherish
her name in silence, and to confine the story of her virtues to that
circle who knew her too well to ask a proof, or utter a doubt, the partisans
of Lord Byron were embarrassed with no such scruple.</p>
<p>Lord Byron had artfully contrived during his life to place his wife
in such an antagonistic position with regard to himself, that his intimate
friends were forced to believe that one of the two had deliberately
and wantonly injured the other.&nbsp; The published statement of Lady
Byron contradicted boldly and point-blank all the statement of her husband
concerning the separation; so that, unless <i>she</i> was convicted
as a false witness, <i>he</i> certainly was.</p>
<p>The best evidence of this is Christopher North&rsquo;s own shocked,
astonished statement, and the words of the Noctes Club.</p>
<p>The noble life that Lady Byron lived after this hushed every voice,
and silenced even the most desperate calumny, <i>while she was in the
world</i>.&nbsp; In the face of Lady Byron as the world saw her, of
what use was the talk of Clytemnestra, and the assertion that she had
been a mean, deceitful conspirator against her husband&rsquo;s honour
in life, and stabbed his memory after death?</p>
<p>But when she was in her grave, when her voice and presence and good
deeds no more spoke for her, and a new generation was growing up that
knew her not; <i>then</i> was the time selected to revive the assault
on her memory, and to say over her grave what none would ever have dared
to say of her while living.</p>
<p>During these last two years, I have been gradually awakening to the
evidence of a new crusade against the memory of Lady Byron, which respected
no sanctity,&mdash;not even that last and most awful one of death.</p>
<p>Nine years after her death, when it was fully understood that no
story on her side or that of her friends was to be forthcoming, then
her calumniators raked out from the ashes of her husband&rsquo;s sepulchre
all his bitter charges, to state them over in even stronger and more
indecent forms.</p>
<p>There seems to be reason to think that the materials supplied by
Lord Byron for such a campaign yet exist in society.</p>
<p>To &lsquo;The Noctes&rsquo; of November 1824, there is the following
note <i>apropos</i> to a discussion of the Byron question:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Byron&rsquo;s Memoirs, given by him to Moore,
were burned, as everybody knows.&nbsp; But, before this, Moore had lent
them to several persons.&nbsp; Mrs. Home Purvis, afterwards Viscountess
of Canterbury, is known to have sat up all one night, in which, aided
by her daughter, she had a copy made.&nbsp; I have the strongest reason
for believing that one other person made a copy; for the description
of the first twenty-four hours after the marriage ceremonial has been
in my hands.&nbsp; Not until after the death of Lady Byron, and Hobhouse,
who was the poet&rsquo;s literary executor, can the poet&rsquo;s Autobiography
see the light; but I am certain it will be published.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus speaks Mackenzie in a note to a volume of &lsquo;The Noctes,&rsquo;
published in America in 1854.&nbsp; Lady Byron died in 1860.</p>
<p>Nine years after Lady Byron&rsquo;s death, when it was ascertained
that her story was not to see the light, when there were no means of
judging her character by her own writings, commenced a well-planned
set of operations to turn the public attention once more to Lord Byron,
and to represent him as an injured man, whose testimony had been unjustly
suppressed.</p>
<p>It was quite possible, supposing copies of the Autobiography to exist,
that this might occasion a call from the generation of to-day, in answer
to which the suppressed work might appear.&nbsp; This was a rather delicate
operation to commence; but the instrument was not wanting.&nbsp; It
was necessary that the subject should be first opened by some irresponsible
party, whom more powerful parties might, as by accident, recognise and
patronise, and on whose weakness they might build something stronger.</p>
<p>Just such an instrument was to be found in Paris.&nbsp; The mistress
of Lord Byron could easily be stirred up and flattered to come before
the world with a book which should re-open the whole controversy; and
she proved a facile tool.&nbsp; At first, the work appeared prudently
in French, and was called &lsquo;Lord Byron jug&eacute; par les T&eacute;moins
de sa Vie,&rsquo; and was rather a failure.&nbsp; Then it was translated
into English, and published by Bentley.</p>
<p>The book was inartistic, and helplessly, childishly stupid as to
any literary merits,&mdash;a mere mass of gossip and twaddle; but after
all, when one remembers the taste of the thousands of circulating-library
readers, it must not be considered the less likely to be widely read
on that account.&nbsp; It is only once in a century that a writer of
real genius has the art to tell his story so as to take both the cultivated
few and the average many.&nbsp; De Foe and John Bunyan are almost the
only examples.&nbsp; But there is a certain class of reading that sells
and spreads, and exerts a vast influence, which the upper circles of
literature despise too much ever to fairly estimate its power.</p>
<p>However, the Guiccioli book did not want for patrons in the high
places of literature.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo;&mdash;the old
classic magazine of England; the defender of conservatism and aristocracy;
the paper of Lockhart, Wilson, Hogg, Walter Scott, and a host of departed
grandeurs&mdash;was deputed to usher into the world this book, and to
recommend it and its author to the Christian public of the nineteenth
century.</p>
<p>The following is the manner in which &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; calls
attention to it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;One of the most beautiful of the songs of B&eacute;ranger
is that addressed to his Lisette, in which he pictures her, in old age,
narrating to a younger generation the loves of their youth; decking
his portrait with flowers at each returning spring, and reciting the
verses that had been inspired by her vanished charms:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lorsque les yeux chercheront sous vos rides<br />
Les traits charmants qui m&rsquo;auront inspir&eacute;,<br />
Des doux r&eacute;cits les jeunes gens avides,<br />
Diront: Quel fut cet ami tant pleur&eacute;?<br />
De men amour peignez, s&rsquo;il est possible,<br />
Vardeur, l&rsquo;ivresse, et m&ecirc;me les soup&ccedil;ons,<br />
Et bonne vieille, an coin d&rsquo;un feu paisible<br />
De votre ami r&eacute;p&eacute;tez les chansons.<br />
&ldquo;On vous dira: Savait-il &ecirc;tre aimable?<br />
Et sans rougir vous direz: Je l&rsquo;aimais.<br />
D&rsquo;un trait m&eacute;chant se montra-t-il capable?<br />
Avec orgueil vous r&eacute;pondrez: Jamais!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This charming picture,&rsquo; &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; goes
on to say, &lsquo;has been realised in the case of a poet greater than
B&eacute;ranger, and by a mistress more famous than Lisette.&nbsp; The
Countess Guiccioli has at length given to the world her &ldquo;Recollections
of Lord Byron.&rdquo;&nbsp; The book first appeared in France under
the title of &ldquo;Lord Byron jug&eacute; par les T&eacute;moins de
sa Vie,&rdquo; without the name of the countess.&nbsp; A more unfortunate
designation could hardly have been selected.&nbsp; The &ldquo;witnesses
of his life&rdquo; told us nothing but what had been told before over
and over again; and the uniform and exaggerated tone of eulogy which
pervaded the whole book was fatal to any claim on the part of the writer
to be considered an impartial judge of the wonderfully mixed character
of Byron.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When, however, the book is regarded as the avowed production
of the Countess Guiccioli, it derives value and interest from its very
faults.&nbsp; <a name="citation113"></a><a href="#footnote113">{113}</a>&nbsp;
There is something inexpressibly touching in the picture of the old
lady calling up the phantoms of half a century ago; not faded and stricken
by the hand of time, but brilliant and gorgeous as they were when Byron,
in his manly prime of genius and beauty, first flashed upon her enraptured
sight, and she gave her whole soul up to an absorbing passion, the embers
of which still glow in her heart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To her there has been no change, no decay.&nbsp; The god whom
she worshipped with all the ardour of her Italian nature at seventeen
is still the &ldquo;Pythian of the age&rdquo; to her at seventy.&nbsp;
To try such a book by the ordinary canons of criticism would be as absurd
as to arraign the authoress before a jury of British matrons, or to
prefer a bill of indictment against the Sultan for bigamy to a Middlesex
grand jury.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, then, is the introduction which one of the oldest and most
classical periodicals of Great Britain gives to a very stupid book,
simply because it was written by Lord Byron&rsquo;s mistress.&nbsp;
<i>That fact</i>, we are assured, lends grace even to its faults.</p>
<p>Having brought the authoress upon the stage, the review now goes
on to define her position, and assure the Christian world that</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The Countess Guiccioli was the daughter of an
impoverished noble.&nbsp; At the age of sixteen, she was taken from
a convent, and sold as third wife to the Count Guiccioli, who was old,
rich, and profligate.&nbsp; A fouler prostitution never profaned the
name of marriage.&nbsp; A short time afterwards, she accidentally met
Lord Byron.&nbsp; Outraged and rebellious nature vindicated itself in
the deep and devoted passion with which he inspired her.&nbsp; With
the full assent of husband, father, and brother, and in compliance with
the usages of Italian society, he was shortly afterwards installed in
the office, and invested with all the privileges, of her &ldquo;Cavalier
Servente.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has been asserted that the Marquis de Boissy, the late husband
of this Guiccioli lady, was in the habit of introducing her in fashionable
circles as &lsquo;the Marquise de Boissy, my wife, formerly mistress
to Lord Byron&rsquo;!&nbsp; We do not give the story as a verity; yet,
in the review of this whole history, we may be pardoned for thinking
it quite possible.</p>
<p>The mistress, being thus vouched for and presented as worthy of sympathy
and attention by one of the oldest and most classic organs of English
literature, may now proceed in her work of glorifying the popular idol,
and casting abuse on the grave of the dead wife.</p>
<p>Her attacks on Lady Byron are, to be sure, less skilful and adroit
than those of Lord Byron.&nbsp; They want his literary polish and tact;
but what of that?&nbsp; &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; assures us that even
the faults of manner derive a peculiar grace from the fact that the
narrator is Lord Byron&rsquo;s mistress; and so we suppose the literary
world must find grace in things like this:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;She has been called, after his words, the moral
Clytemnestra of her husband.&nbsp; Such a surname is severe: but the
repugnance we feel to condemning a woman cannot prevent our listening
to the voice of justice, which tells us that the comparison is still
in favour of the guilty one of antiquity; for she, driven to crime by
fierce passion overpowering reason, at least only deprived her husband
of physical life, and, in committing the deed, exposed herself to all
its consequences; while Lady Byron left her husband at the very moment
that she saw him struggling amid a thousand shoals in the stormy sea
of embarrassments created by his marriage, and precisely when he more
than ever required a friendly, tender, and indulgent hand to save him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Besides, she shut herself up in silence a thousand times more
cruel than Clytemnestra&rsquo;s poniard: that only killed the body;
whereas Lady Byron&rsquo;s silence was destined to kill the soul,&mdash;and
such a soul!&mdash;leaving the door open to calumny, and making it to
be supposed that her silence was magnanimity destined to cover over
frightful wrongs, perhaps even depravity.&nbsp; In vain did he, feeling
his conscience at ease, implore some inquiry and examination.&nbsp;
She refused; and the only favour she granted was to send him, one fine
day, two persons to see whether he were not mad.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, why, then, had she believed him mad?&nbsp; Because she,
a methodical, inflexible woman, with that unbendingness which a profound
moralist calls the worship rendered to pride by a feelingless soul,
because she could not understand the possibility of tastes and habits
different to those of ordinary routine, or of her own starched life.&nbsp;
Not to be hungry when she was; not to sleep at night, but to write while
she was sleeping, and to sleep when she was up; in short, to gratify
the requirements of material and intellectual life at hours different
to hers,&mdash;all that was not merely annoying for her, but it must
be madness; or, if not, it betokened depravity that she could neither
submit to nor tolerate without perilling her own morality.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such was the grand secret of the cruel silence which exposed
Lord Byron to the most malignant interpretations, to all the calumny
and revenge of his enemies.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was, perhaps, the only woman in the world so strangely
organised,&mdash;the only one, perhaps, capable of not feeling happy
and proud at belonging to a man superior to the rest of humanity; and
fatally was it decreed that this woman alone of her species should be
Lord Byron&rsquo;s wife!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a note is added,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;If an imaginary fear, and even an unreasonable
jealousy, may be her excuse (just as one excuses a monomania), can one
equally forgive her silence?&nbsp; Such a silence is morally what are
physically the poisons which kill at once, and defy all remedies; thus
insuring the culprit&rsquo;s safety.&nbsp; This silence it is which
will ever be her crime; for by it she poisoned the life of her husband.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book has several chapters devoted to Lord Byron&rsquo;s peculiar
virtues; and under the one devoted to magnanimity and heroism, his <i>forgiving</i>
disposition receives special attention.&nbsp; The climax of all is stated
to be that he forgave Lady Byron.&nbsp; All the world knew that, since
he had declared this fact in a very noisy and impassioned manner in
the fourth canto of &lsquo;Childe Harold,&rsquo; together with a statement
of the wrongs which he forgave; but the Guiccioli thinks his virtue,
at this period, has not been enough appreciated.&nbsp; In her view,
it rose to the sublime.&nbsp; She says of Lady Byron,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;An absolute moral monstrosity, an anomaly in the
history of types of female hideousness, had succeeded in showing itself
in the light of magnanimity.&nbsp; But false as was this high quality
in Lady Byron, so did it shine out in him true and admirable.&nbsp;
The position in which Lady Byron had placed him, and where she continued
to keep him by her harshness, silence, and strange refusals, was one
of those which cause such suffering, that the highest degree of self-control
seldom suffices to quiet the promptings of human weakness, and to cause
persons of even slight sensibility to preserve moderation.&nbsp; Yet,
with his sensibility and the knowledge of his worth, how did he act?
what did he say?&nbsp; I will not speak of his &ldquo;farewell;&rdquo;
of the care he took to shield her from blame by throwing it on others,
by taking much too large a share to himself.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With like vivacity and earnestness does the narrator now proceed
to make an incarnate angel of her subject by the simple process of denying
everything that he himself ever confessed,&mdash;everything that has
ever been confessed in regard to him by his best friends.&nbsp; He has
been in the world as an angel unawares from his cradle.&nbsp; His guardian
did not properly appreciate him, and is consequently mentioned as that
wicked Lord Carlisle.&nbsp; Thomas Moore is never to be sufficiently
condemned for the facts told in his biography.&nbsp; Byron&rsquo;s own
frank and lawless admissions of evil are set down to a peculiar inability
he had for speaking the truth about himself,&mdash;sometimes about his
near relations; all which does not in the least discourage the authoress
from giving a separate chapter on &lsquo;Lord Byron&rsquo;s Love of
Truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the matter of his relations with women, she complacently repeats
(what sounds rather oddly as coming from her) Lord Byron&rsquo;s own
assurance, that he <i>never</i> seduced a woman; and also the equally
convincing statement, that he had told <i>her</i> (the Guiccioli) that
his married fidelity to his wife was perfect.&nbsp; She discusses Moore&rsquo;s
account of the mistress in boy&rsquo;s clothes who used to share Byron&rsquo;s
apartments in college, and ride with him to races, and whom he presented
to <i>ladies</i> as his brother.</p>
<p>She has her own view of this matter.&nbsp; The disguised boy was
a lady of rank and fashion, who sought Lord Byron&rsquo;s chambers,
as, we are informed, noble ladies everywhere, both in Italy and England,
were constantly in the habit of doing; throwing themselves at his feet,
and imploring permission to become his handmaids.</p>
<p>In the authoress&rsquo;s own words, &lsquo;Feminine overtures still
continued to be made to Lord Byron; but the fumes of incense never hid
from his sight his IDEAL.&rsquo;&nbsp; We are told that in the case
of these poor ladies, generally &lsquo;disenchantment took place on
his side without a corresponding result on the other: THENCE many heart-breakings.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Nevertheless, we are informed that there followed the indiscretions
of these ladies &lsquo;none of those proceedings that the world readily
forgives, but which his feelings as a man of honour would have condemned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As to drunkenness, and all that, we are informed he was an anchorite.&nbsp;
Pages are given to an account of the biscuits and soda-water that on
this and that occasion were found to be the sole means of sustenance
to this ethereal creature.</p>
<p>As to the story of using his wife&rsquo;s money, the lady gives,
directly in the face of his own Letters and Journal, the same account
given before by Medwin, and which caused such merriment when talked
over in the Noctes Club,&mdash;that he had with her only a marriage
portion of &pound;10,000; and that, on the separation, he not only paid
it back, but doubled it. <a name="citation119"></a><a href="#footnote119">{119}</a></p>
<p>So on the authoress goes, sowing right and left the most transparent
absurdities and misstatements with what Carlyle well calls &lsquo;a
composed stupidity, and a cheerful infinitude of ignorance.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Who <i>should</i> know, if not she, to be sure?&nbsp; Had not Byron
told her all about it? and was not his family motto <i>Crede Byron</i>?</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Blackwood,&rsquo; having a dim suspicion that this confused
style of attack and defence in reference to the two parties under consideration
may not have great weight, itself proceeds to make the book an occasion
for re-opening the controversy of Lord Byron with his wife.</p>
<p>The rest of the review devoted to a powerful attack on Lady Byron&rsquo;s
character, the most fearful attack on the memory of a dead woman we
have ever seen made by living man.&nbsp; The author proceeds, like a
lawyer, to gather up, arrange, and restate, in a most workmanlike manner,
the confused accusations of the book.</p>
<p>Anticipating the objection, that such a re-opening of the inquiry
was a violation of the privacy due to womanhood and to the feelings
of a surviving family, he says, that though marriage usually is a private
matter which the world has no right to intermeddle with or discuss,
yet&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Lord Byron&rsquo;s was an exceptional case.&nbsp;
It is not too much to say, that, had his marriage been a happy one,
the course of events of the present century might have been materially
changed; that the genius which poured itself forth in &ldquo;Don Juan&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Cain&rdquo; might have flowed in far different channels;
that the ardent love of freedom which sent him to perish at six and
thirty at Missolonghi might have inspired a long career at home; and
that we might at this moment have been appealing to the counsels of
his experience and wisdom at an age not exceeding that which was attained
by Wellington, Lyndhurst, and Brougham.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whether the world would have been a gainer or a loser by the
exchange is a question which every man must answer for himself, according
to his own tastes and opinions; but the possibility of such a change
in the course of events warrants us in treating what would otherwise
be a strictly private matter as one of public interest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;More than half a century has elapsed, the actors have departed
from the stage, the curtain has fallen; and whether it will ever again
be raised so as to reveal the real facts of the drama, may, as we have
already observed, be well doubted.&nbsp; But the time has arrived when
we may fairly gather up the fragments of evidence, clear them as far
as possible from the incrustations of passion, prejudice, and malice,
and place them in such order, as, if possible, to enable us to arrive
at some probable conjecture as to what the skeleton of the drama originally
was.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the writer proceeds to put together all the facts of Lady Byron&rsquo;s
case, just as an adverse lawyer would put them as against her, and for
her husband.&nbsp; The plea is made vigorously and ably, and with an
air of indignant severity, as of an honest advocate who is thoroughly
convinced that he is pleading the cause of a wronged man who has been
ruined in name, shipwrecked in life, and driven to an early grave, by
the arts of a bad woman,&mdash;a woman all the more horrible that her
malice was disguised under the cloak of religion.</p>
<p>Having made an able statement of facts, adroitly leaving out ONE,
<a name="citation121"></a><a href="#footnote121">{121}</a> of which
he could not have been ignorant had he studied the case carefully enough
to know all the others, he proceeds to sum up against the criminal thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;We would deal tenderly with the memory of Lady
Byron.&nbsp; Few women have been juster objects of compassion.&nbsp;
It would seem as if Nature and Fortune had vied with each other which
should be most lavish of her gifts, and yet that some malignant power
had rendered all their bounty of no effect.&nbsp; Rank, beauty, wealth,
and mental powers of no common order, were hers; yet they were of no
avail to secure common happiness.&nbsp; The spoilt child of seclusion,
restraint, and parental idolatry, a fate (alike evil for both) cast
her into the arms of the spoilt child of genius, passion, and the world.&nbsp;
What real or fancied wrongs she suffered, we may never know; but those
which she inflicted are sufficiently apparent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is said that there are some poisons so subtle that they
will destroy life, and yet leave no trace of their action.&nbsp; The
murderer who uses them may escape the vengeance of the law; but he is
not the less guilty.&nbsp; So the slanderer who makes no charge; who
deals in hints and insinuations: who knows melancholy facts he would
not willingly divulge,&mdash;things too painful to state; who forbears,
expresses pity, sometimes even affection, for his victim, shrugs his
shoulders, looks with</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The significant eye,<br />
Which learns to lie with silence,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>is far more guilty than he who tells the bold falsehood which may
be met and answered, and who braves the punishment which must follow
upon detection.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lady Byron has been called</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The moral Clytemnestra of her lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;moral Brinvilliers&rdquo; would have been a truer designation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The conclusion at which we arrive is, that there is no proof
whatever that Lord Byron was guilty of any act that need have caused
a separation, or prevented a re-union, and that the imputations upon
him rest on the vaguest conjecture; that whatever real or fancied wrongs
Lady Byron may have endured are shrouded in an impenetrable mist of
her own creation,&mdash;a poisonous miasma in which she enveloped the
character of her husband, raised by her breath, and which her breath
only could have dispersed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She dies and makes no sign.&nbsp; O God!
forgive her.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we have been obliged to review accusations on Lady Byron founded
on old Greek tragedy, so now we are forced to abridge a passage from
a modern conversations-lexicon, that we may understand what sort of
comparisons are deemed in good taste in a conservative English review,
when speaking of ladies of rank in their graves.</p>
<p>Under the article &lsquo;Brinvilliers,&rsquo; we find as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>MARGUERITE D&rsquo;AUBRAI, MARCHIONESS OF BRINVILLIERS.&mdash;The
singular atrocity of this woman gives her a sort of infamous claim to
notice.&nbsp; She was born in Paris in 1651; being daughter of D&rsquo;Aubrai,
lieutenant-civil of Paris, who married her to the Marquis of Brinvilliers.&nbsp;
Although possessed of attractions to captivate lovers, she was for some
time much attached to her husband, but at length became madly in love
with a Gascon officer.&nbsp; Her father imprisoned the officer in the
Bastille; and, while there, he learned the art of compounding subtle
and most mortal poisons; and, when he was released, he taught it to
the lady, who exercised it with such success, that, in one year, her
father, sister, and two brothers became her victims.&nbsp; She professed
the utmost tenderness for her victims, and nursed them assiduously.&nbsp;
On her father she is said to have made eight attempts before she succeeded.&nbsp;
She was very religious, and devoted to works of charity; and visited
the hospitals a great deal, where it is said she tried her poisons on
the sick.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People have made loud outcries lately, both in America and England,
about violating the repose of the dead.&nbsp; We should like to know
what they call this.&nbsp; Is this, then, what they mean by <i>respecting</i>
the dead?</p>
<p>Let any man imagine a leading review coming out with language equally
brutal about his own mother, or any dear and revered friend.</p>
<p>Men of America, men of England, what do you think of this?</p>
<p>When Lady Byron was publicly branded with the names of the foulest
ancient and foulest modern assassins, and Lord Byron&rsquo;s mistress
was publicly taken by the hand, and encouraged to go on and prosper
in her slanders, by one of the oldest and most influential British reviews,
what was said and what was done in England?</p>
<p>That is a question we should be glad to have answered.&nbsp; Nothing
was done that ever reached us across the water.</p>
<p>And why was nothing done?&nbsp; Is this language of a kind to be
passed over in silence?</p>
<p>Was it no offence to the house of Wentworth to attack the pure character
of its late venerable head, and to brand her in her sacred grave with
the name of one of the vilest of criminals?</p>
<p>Might there not properly have been an indignant protest of family
solicitors against this insult to the person and character of the Baroness
Wentworth?</p>
<p>If virtue went for nothing, benevolence for nothing, a long life
of service to humanity for nothing, one would at least have thought,
that, in aristocratic countries, rank might have had its rights to decent
consideration, and its guardians to rebuke the violation of those rights.</p>
<p>We Americans understand little of the advantages of rank; but we
did understand that it secured certain decorums to people, both while
living and when in their graves.&nbsp; From Lady Byron&rsquo;s whole
history, in life and in death, it would appear that we were mistaken.</p>
<p>What a life was hers!&nbsp; Was ever a woman more evidently desirous
of the delicate and secluded privileges of womanhood, of the sacredness
of individual privacy?&nbsp; Was ever a woman so rudely dragged forth,
and exposed to the hardened, vulgar, and unfeeling gaze of mere curiosity?&mdash;her
maiden secrets of love thrown open to be handled by <i>rou&eacute;s</i>;
the sanctities of her marriage-chamber desecrated by leering satyrs;
her parents and best friends traduced and slandered, till one indignant
public protest was extorted from her, as by the rack,&mdash;a protest
which seems yet to quiver in every word with the indignation of outraged
womanly delicacy!</p>
<p>Then followed coarse blame and coarser comment,&mdash;blame for speaking
at all, and blame for not speaking more.&nbsp; One manly voice, raised
for her in honourable protest, was silenced and overborne by the universal
roar of ridicule and reprobation; and henceforth what refuge?&nbsp;
Only this remained: &lsquo;Let them that suffer according to the will
of God commit the keeping of their souls to him as to a faithful Creator.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Byron turned to this refuge in silence, and filled up her life
with a noble record of charities and humanities.&nbsp; So pure was she,
so childlike, so artless, so loving, that those who knew her best, feel,
to this day, that a memorial of her is like the relic of a saint.&nbsp;
And could not all this preserve her grave from insult?&nbsp; O England,
England!</p>
<p>I speak in sorrow of heart to those who must have known, loved, and
revered Lady Byron, and ask them, Of what were you thinking when you
allowed a paper of so established literary rank as the &lsquo;Blackwood,&rsquo;
to present and earnestly recommend to our New World such a compendium
of lies as the Guiccioli book?</p>
<p>Is the great English-speaking community, whose waves toss from Maine
to California, and whose literature is yet to come back in a thousand
voices to you, a thing to be so despised?</p>
<p>If, as the solicitors of the Wentworth family observe, you might
be entitled to treat with silent contempt the slanders of a mistress
against a wife, was it safe to treat with equal contempt the indorsement
and recommendation of those slanders by one of your oldest and most
powerful literary authorities?</p>
<p>No European magazine has ever had the weight and circulation in America
that the &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; has held.&nbsp; In the days of my youth,
when New England was a comparatively secluded section of the earth,
the wit and genius of the &lsquo;Noctes Ambrosianae&rsquo; were in the
mouths of men and maidens, even in our most quiet mountain-towns.&nbsp;
There, years ago, we saw all Lady Byron&rsquo;s private affairs discussed,
and felt the weight of Christopher North&rsquo;s decisions against her.&nbsp;
Shelton Mackenzie, in his American edition, speaks of the American circulation
of &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; being greater than that in England. <a name="citation126"></a><a href="#footnote126">{126}</a>&nbsp;
It was and is now reprinted monthly; and, besides that, &lsquo;Littell&rsquo;s
Magazine&rsquo; reproduces all its striking articles, and they come
with the weight of long established position.&nbsp; From the very fact
that it has long been considered the Tory organ, and the supporter of
aristocratic orders, all its admissions against the character of individuals
in the privileged classes have a double force.</p>
<p>When &lsquo;Blackwood,&rsquo; therefore, boldly denounces a lady
of high rank as a modern Brinvilliers, and no sensation is produced,
and no remonstrance follows, what can people in the New World suppose,
but that Lady Byron&rsquo;s character was a point entirely given up;
that her depravity was so well established and so fully conceded, that
nothing was to be said, and that even the defenders of aristocracy were
forced to admit it?</p>
<p>I have been blamed for speaking on this subject without consulting
Lady Byron&rsquo;s friends, trustees, and family.&nbsp; More than ten
years had elapsed since I had had any intercourse with England, and
I knew none of them.&nbsp; How was I to know that any of them were living?&nbsp;
I was astonished to learn, for the first time, by the solicitors&rsquo;
letters, that there were trustees, who held in their hands all Lady
Byron&rsquo;s carefully prepared proofs and documents, by which this
falsehood might immediately have been refuted.</p>
<p>If they had spoken, they might have saved all this confusion.&nbsp;
Even if bound by restrictions for a certain period of time, they still
might have called on a Christian public to frown down such a cruel and
indecent attack on the character of a noble lady who had been a benefactress
to so many in England.&nbsp; They might have stated that the means of
wholly refuting the slanders of the &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; were in
their hands, and only delayed in coming forth from regard to the feelings
of some in this generation.&nbsp; Then might they not have announced
her Life and Letters, that the public might have the same opportunity
as themselves for knowing and judging Lady Byron by her own writings?</p>
<p>Had this been done, I had been most happy to have remained silent.&nbsp;
I have been astonished that any one should have supposed this speaking
on my part to be anything less than it is,&mdash;the severest act of
self-sacrifice that one friend can perform for another, and the most
solemn and difficult tribute to justice that a human being can be called
upon to render.</p>
<p>I have been informed that the course I have taken would be contrary
to the wishes of my friend.&nbsp; I think otherwise.&nbsp; I know her
strong sense of justice, and her reverence for truth.&nbsp; Nothing
ever moved her to speak to the public but an attack upon the honour
of the dead.&nbsp; In her statement, she says of her parents, &lsquo;There
is no other near relative to vindicate their memory from insult: I am
therefore compelled to break the silence I had hoped always to have
observed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If there was any near relative to vindicate Lady Byron&rsquo;s memory,
I had no evidence of the fact; and I considered the utter silence to
be strong evidence to the contrary.&nbsp; In all the storm of obloquy
and rebuke that has raged in consequence of my speaking, I have had
two unspeakable sources of joy; first, that they could not touch <i>her</i>;
and, second, that they could not blind the all-seeing God.&nbsp; It
is worth being in darkness to see the stars.</p>
<p>It has been said that <i>I</i> have drawn on Lady Byron&rsquo;s name
greater obloquy than ever before.&nbsp; I deny the charge.&nbsp; Nothing
fouler has been asserted of her than the charges in the &lsquo;Blackwood,&rsquo;
because nothing fouler <i>could</i> be asserted.&nbsp; No satyr&rsquo;s
hoof has ever crushed this pearl deeper in the mire than the hoof of
the &lsquo;Blackwood,&rsquo; but none of them have defiled it or trodden
it so deep that God cannot find it in the day &lsquo;when he maketh
up his jewels.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I have another word, as an American, to say about the contempt shown
to our great people in thus suffering the materials of history to be
falsified to subserve the temporary purposes of family feeling in England.</p>
<p>Lord Byron belongs not properly either to the Byrons or the Wentworths.&nbsp;
He is not one of their family jewels to be locked up in their cases.&nbsp;
He belongs to the world for which he wrote, to which he appealed, and
before which he dragged his reluctant, delicate wife to a publicity
equal with his own: the world has, therefore, a right to judge him.</p>
<p>We Americans have been made accessories, after the fact, to every
insult and injury that Lord Byron and the literary men of his day have
heaped upon Lady Byron.&nbsp; We have been betrayed into injustice and
a complicity with villainy.&nbsp; After Lady Byron had nobly lived down
slanders in England, and died full of years and honours, the &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo;
takes occasion to re-open the controversy by recommending a book full
of slanders to a rising generation who knew nothing of the past.&nbsp;
What was the consequence in America?&nbsp; My attention was first called
to the result, not by reading the &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; article, but
by finding in a popular monthly magazine two long articles,&mdash;the
one an enthusiastic recommendation of the Guiccioli book, and the other
a lamentation over the burning of the Autobiography as a lost chapter
in history.</p>
<p>Both articles represented Lady Byron as a cold, malignant, mean,
persecuting woman, who had been her husband&rsquo;s ruin.&nbsp; They
were so full of falsehoods and misstatements as to astonish me.&nbsp;
Not long after, a literary friend wrote to me, <i>&lsquo;Will</i> you,
<i>can</i> you, reconcile it to your conscience to sit still and allow
that mistress so to slander that wife,&mdash;you, perhaps, the only
one knowing the real facts, and able to set them forth?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Upon this, I immediately began collecting and reading the various
articles and the book, and perceived that the public of this generation
were in a way of having false history created, uncontradicted, under
their own eyes.</p>
<p>I claim for my countrymen and women, our right to <i>true</i> history.&nbsp;
For years, the popular literature has held up publicly before our eyes
the facts as to this man and this woman, and called on us to praise
or condemn.&nbsp; Let us have <i>truth</i> when we are called on to
judge.&nbsp; It is our <i>right</i>.</p>
<p>There is no conceivable obligation on a human being greater than
that of <i>absolute justice</i>.&nbsp; It is the deepest personal injury
to an honourable mind to be made, through misrepresentation, an accomplice
in injustice.&nbsp; When a noble name is accused, any person who possesses
truth which might clear it, and withholds that truth, is guilty of a
sin against human nature and the inalienable rights of justice.&nbsp;
I claim that I have not only a right, but an obligation, to bring in
my solemn testimony upon this subject.</p>
<p>For years and years, the silence-policy has been tried; and what
has it brought forth?&nbsp; As neither word nor deed could be proved
against Lady Byron, her silence has been spoken of as a monstrous, unnatural
crime, &lsquo;a poisonous miasma,&rsquo; in which she enveloped the
name of her husband.</p>
<p>Very well; since silence is the crime, I thought I would tell the
world that Lady Byron had spoken.</p>
<p>Christopher North, years ago, when he condemned her for speaking,
said that she should speak further,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She should speak, or some one for her.&nbsp; One word would
suffice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That one word has been spoken.</p>
<h2>PART II.</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I.&nbsp; LADY BYRON AS I KNEW HER.</h3>
<p>An editorial in The London Times&rsquo; of Sept. 18 says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The perplexing feature in this &ldquo;True Story&rdquo;
is, that it is impossible to distinguish what part in it is the editress&rsquo;s,
and what Lady Byron&rsquo;s own.&nbsp; We are given the impression made
on Mrs. Stowe&rsquo;s mind by Lady Byron&rsquo;s statements; but it
would have been more satisfactory if the statement itself had been reproduced
as bare as possible, and been left to make its own impression on the
public.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In reply to this, I will say, that in my article I gave a brief synopsis
of the subject-matter of Lady Byron&rsquo;s communications; and I think
it must be quite evident to the world that the <i>main fact</i> on which
the story turns was one which could not possibly be misunderstood, and
the remembrance of which no lapse of time could ever weaken.</p>
<p>Lady Byron&rsquo;s communications were made to me in language clear,
precise, terrible; and many of her phrases and sentences I could repeat
at this day, word for word.&nbsp; But if I had reproduced them at first,
as &lsquo;The Times&rsquo; suggests, word for word, the public horror
and incredulity would have been doubled.&nbsp; It was necessary that
the brutality of the story should, in some degree, be veiled and softened.</p>
<p>The publication, by Lord Lindsay, of Lady Anne Barnard&rsquo;s communication,
makes it now possible to tell fully, and in Lady Byron&rsquo;s own words,
certain incidents that yet remain untold.&nbsp; To me, who know the
whole history, the revelations in Lady Anne&rsquo;s account, and the
story related by Lady Byron, are like fragments of a dissected map:
they fit together, piece by piece, and form one connected whole.</p>
<p>In confirmation of the general facts of this interview, I have the
testimony of a sister who accompanied me on this visit, and to whom,
immediately after it, I recounted the story.</p>
<p>Her testimony on the subject is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;MY DEAR SISTER,&mdash;I have a perfect recollection
of going with you to visit Lady Byron at the time spoken of in your
published article.&nbsp; We arrived at her house in the morning; and,
after lunch, Lady Byron and yourself spent the whole time till evening
alone together.</p>
<p>&lsquo;After we retired to our apartment that night, you related
to me the story given in your published account, though with many more
particulars than you have yet thought fit to give to the public.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You stated to me that Lady Byron was strongly impressed with
the idea that it might be her duty to publish a statement during her
lifetime, and also the reasons which induced her to think so.&nbsp;
You appeared at that time quite disposed to think that justice required
this step, and asked my opinion.&nbsp; We passed most of the night in
conversation on the subject,&mdash;a conversation often resumed, from
time to time, during several weeks in which you were considering what
opinion to give.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I was strongly of opinion that justice required the publication
of the truth, but felt exceedingly averse to its being done by Lady
Byron herself during her own lifetime, when she personally would be
subject to the comments and misconceptions of motives which would certainly
follow such a communication.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Your
sister,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;M.
F. PERKINS.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am now about to complete the account of my conversation with Lady
Byron; but as the credibility of a history depends greatly on the character
of its narrator, and as especial pains have been taken to destroy the
belief in this story by representing it to be the wanderings of a broken-down
mind in a state of dotage and mental hallucination, I shall preface
the narrative with some account of Lady Byron as she was during the
time of our mutual acquaintance and friendship.</p>
<p>This account may, perhaps, be deemed superfluous in England, where
so many knew her; but in America, where, from Maine to California, her
character has been discussed and traduced, it is of importance to give
interested thousands an opportunity of learning what kind of a woman
Lady Byron was.</p>
<p>Her character as given by Lord Byron in his Journal, after her first
refusal of him, is this:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;She is a very superior woman, and very little
spoiled; which is strange in an heiress, a girl of twenty, a peeress
that is to be in her own right, an only child, and a savante, who has
always had her own way.&nbsp; She is a poetess, a mathematician, a metaphysician;
yet, withal, very kind, generous, and gentle, with very little pretension.&nbsp;
Any other head would be turned with half her acquisitions and a tenth
of her advantages.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such was Lady Byron at twenty.&nbsp; I formed her acquaintance in
the year 1853, during my first visit in England.&nbsp; I met her at
a lunch-party in the house of one of her friends.</p>
<p>The party had many notables; but, among them all, my attention was
fixed principally on Lady Byron.&nbsp; She was at this time sixty-one
years of age, but still had, to a remarkable degree, that personal attraction
which is commonly considered to belong only to youth and beauty.</p>
<p>Her form was slight, giving an impression of fragility; her motions
were both graceful and decided; her eyes bright, and full of interest
and quick observation.&nbsp; Her silvery-white hair seemed to lend a
grace to the transparent purity of her complexion, and her small hands
had a pearly whiteness.&nbsp; I recollect she wore a plain widow&rsquo;s
cap of a transparent material; and was dressed in some delicate shade
of lavender, which harmonised well with her complexion.</p>
<p>When I was introduced to her, I felt in a moment the words of her
husband:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;There was awe in the homage that she drew;<br />
Her spirit seemed as seated on a throne.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Calm, self-poised, and thoughtful, she seemed to me rather to resemble
an interested spectator of the world&rsquo;s affairs, than an actor
involved in its trials; yet the sweetness of her smile, and a certain
very delicate sense of humour in her remarks, made the way of acquaintance
easy.</p>
<p>Her first remarks were a little playful; but in a few moments we
were speaking on what every one in those days was talking to me about,&mdash;the
slavery question in America.</p>
<p>It need not be remarked, that, when any one subject especially occupies
the public mind, those known to be interested in it are compelled to
listen to many weary platitudes.&nbsp; Lady Byron&rsquo;s remarks, however,
caught my ear and arrested my attention by their peculiar incisive quality,
their originality, and the evidence they gave that she was as well informed
on all our matters as the best American statesman could be.&nbsp; I
had no wearisome course to go over with her as to the difference between
the General Government and State Governments, nor explanations of the
United States Constitution; for she had the whole before her mind with
a perfect clearness.&nbsp; Her morality upon the slavery question, too,
impressed me as something far higher and deeper than the common sentimentalism
of the day.&nbsp; Many of her words surprised me greatly, and gave me
new material for thought.</p>
<p>I found I was in company with a commanding mind, and hastened to
gain instruction from her on another point where my interest had been
aroused.&nbsp; I had recently been much excited by Kingsley&rsquo;s
novels, &lsquo;Alton Locke&rsquo; and &lsquo;Yeast,&rsquo; on the position
of religious thought in England.&nbsp; From these works I had gathered,
that under the apparent placid uniformity of the Established Church
of England, and of &lsquo;good society&rsquo; as founded on it, there
was moving a secret current of speculative enquiry, doubt, and dissent;
but I had met, as yet, with no person among my various acquaintances
in England who seemed either aware of this fact, or able to guide my
mind respecting it.&nbsp; The moment I mentioned the subject to Lady
Byron, I received an answer which showed me that the whole ground was
familiar to her, and that she was capable of giving me full information.&nbsp;
She had studied with careful thoughtfulness all the social and religious
tendencies of England during her generation.&nbsp; One of her remarks
has often since occurred to me.&nbsp; Speaking of the Oxford movement,
she said the time had come when the English Church could no longer remain
as it was.&nbsp; It must either <i>restore the past, or create a future</i>.&nbsp;
The Oxford movement attempted the former; and of the future she was
beginning to speak, when our conversation was interrupted by the presentation
of other parties.</p>
<p>Subsequently, in reply to a note from her on some benevolent business,
I alluded to that conversation, and expressed a wish that she would
finish giving me her views of the religious state of England.&nbsp;
A portion of the letter that she wrote me in reply I insert, as being
very characteristic in many respects:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Various causes have been assigned for the decaying
state of the English Church; which seems the more strange, because the
clergy have improved, morally and intellectually, in the last twenty
years.&nbsp; Then why should their influence be diminished?&nbsp; I
think it is owing to the diffusion of a spirit of free enquiry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Doubts have arisen in the minds of many who are unhappily
bound by subscription not to doubt; and, in consequence, they are habitually
pretending either to believe or to disbelieve.&nbsp; The state of Denmark
cannot but be rotten, when to seem is the first object of the witnesses
of truth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;They may lead better lives, and bring forward abler arguments;
but their efforts are paralysed by that unsoundness.&nbsp; I see the
High Churchman professing to believe in the existence of a church, when
the most palpable facts must show him that no such church exists; the
&ldquo;Low&rdquo; Churchman professing to believe in exceptional interpositions
which his philosophy secretly questions; the &ldquo;Broad&rdquo; Churchman
professing as absolute an attachment to the Established Church as the
narrowest could feel, while he is preaching such principles as will
at last pull it down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I ask you, my friend, whether there would not be more faith,
as well as earnestness, if all would speak out.&nbsp; There would be
more unanimity too, because they would all agree in a certain basis.&nbsp;
Would not a wider love supersede the creed-bound charity of sects?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am aware that I have touched on a point of difference between
us, and I will not regret it; for I think the differences of mind are
analogous to those differences of nature, which, in the most comprehensive
survey, are the very elements of harmony.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am not at all prone to put forth my own opinions; but the
tone in which you have written to me claims an unusual degree of openness
on my part.&nbsp; I look upon creeds of all kinds as chains,&mdash;far
worse chains than those you would break,&mdash;as the causes of much
hypocrisy and infidelity.&nbsp; I hold it to be a sin to make a child
say, &ldquo;I believe.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lead it to utter that belief spontaneously.&nbsp;
I also consider the institution of an exclusive priesthood, though having
been of service in some respects, as retarding the progress of Christianity
at present.&nbsp; I desire to see a lay ministry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will not give you more of my heterodoxy at present: perhaps
I need your pardon, connected as you are with the Church, for having
said so much.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are causes of decay known to be at work in my frame,
which lead me to believe I may not have time to grow wiser; and I must
therefore leave it to others to correct the conclusions I have now formed
from my life&rsquo;s experience.&nbsp; I should feel happy to discuss
them personally with you; for it would be soul to soul.&nbsp; In that
confidence I am yours most truly,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;A.

<p>It is not necessary to prove to the reader that this letter is not
in the style of a broken-down old woman subject to mental hallucinations.&nbsp;
It shows Lady Byron&rsquo;s habits of clear, searching analysis, her
thoughtfulness, and, above all, that peculiar reverence for <i>truth</i>
and sincerity which was a leading characteristic of her moral nature.
<a name="citation139"></a><a href="#footnote139">{139}</a>&nbsp; It
also shows her views of the probable shortness of her stay on earth,
derived from the opinion of physicians about her disease, which was
a gradual ossification of the lungs.&nbsp; It has been asserted that
pulmonary diseases, while they slowly and surely sap the physical life,
often appear to give added vigour to the play of the moral and intellectual
powers.</p>
<p>I parted from Lady Byron, feeling richer in that I had found one
more pearl of great price on the shore of life.</p>
<p>Three years after this, I visited England to obtain a copyright for
the issue of my novel of &lsquo;Dred.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The hope of once more seeing Lady Byron was one of the brightest
anticipations held out to me in this journey.&nbsp; I found London quite
deserted; but, hearing that Lady Byron was still in town, I sent to
her, saying in my note, that, in case she was not well enough to call,
I would visit her.&nbsp; Her reply I give:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;MY DEAR FRIEND,&mdash;I will be indebted to you
for our meeting, as I am barely able to leave my room.&nbsp; It is not
a time for small personalities, if they could ever exist with you; and,
dressed or undressed, I shall hope to see you after two o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Yours
very truly,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;A.
I. NOEL BYRON.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found Lady Byron in her sick-room,&mdash;that place which she made
so different from the chamber of ordinary invalids.&nbsp; Her sick-room
seemed only a telegraphic station whence her vivid mind was flashing
out all over the world.</p>
<p>By her bedside stood a table covered with books, pamphlets, and files
of letters, all arranged with exquisite order, and each expressing some
of her varied interests.&nbsp; From that sick-bed she still directed,
with systematic care, her various works of benevolence, and watched
with intelligent attention the course of science, literature, and religion;
and the versatility and activity of her mind, the flow of brilliant
and penetrating thought on all the topics of the day, gave to the conversations
of her retired room a peculiar charm.&nbsp; You forgot that she was
an invalid; for she rarely had a word of her own personalities, and
the charm of her conversation carried you invariably from herself to
the subjects of which she was thinking.&nbsp; All the new books, the
literature of the hour, were lighted up by her keen, searching, yet
always kindly criticism; and it was charming to get her fresh, genuine,
clear-cut modes of expression, so different from the world-worn phrases
of what is called good society.&nbsp; Her opinions were always perfectly
clear and positive, and given with the freedom of one who has long stood
in a position to judge the world and its ways from her own standpoint.&nbsp;
But it was not merely in general literature and science that her heart
lay; it was following always with eager interest the progress of humanity
over the whole world.</p>
<p>This was the period of the great battle for liberty in Kansas.&nbsp;
The English papers were daily filled with the thrilling particulars
of that desperate struggle, and Lady Byron entered with heart and soul
into it.</p>
<p>Her first letter to me, at this time, is on this subject.&nbsp; It
was while &lsquo;Dred&rsquo; was going through the press.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;CAMBRIDGE
TERRACE, Aug. 15.</p>
<p>&lsquo;MY DEAR MRS. STOWE,&mdash;Messrs. Chambers liked the proposal
to publish the Kansas Letters.&nbsp; The more the public know of these
matters, the better prepared they will be for your book.&nbsp; The moment
for its publication seems well chosen.&nbsp; There is always in England
a floating fund of sympathy for what is above the everyday sordid cares
of life; and these better feelings, so nobly invested for the last two
years in Florence Nightingale&rsquo;s career, are just set free.&nbsp;
To what will they next be attached?&nbsp; If you can lay hold of them,
they may bring about a deeper abolition than any legislative one,&mdash;the
abolition of the heart-heresy that man&rsquo;s worth comes, not from
God, but from man.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been obliged to give up exertion again, but hope soon
to be able to call and make the acquaintance of your daughters.&nbsp;
In case you wish to consult H. Martineau&rsquo;s pamphlets, I send more
copies.&nbsp; Do not think of answering: I have occupied too much of
your time in reading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Yours
affectionately,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;A.
I. NOEL BYRON.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As soon as a copy of &lsquo;Dred&rsquo; was through the press, I
sent it to her, saying that I had been reproved by some excellent people
for representing too faithfully the profane language of some of the
wicked characters.&nbsp; To this she sent the following reply:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Your book, dear Mrs. Stowe, is of the little leaven
kind, and must prove a great moral force; perhaps not manifestly so
much as secretly.&nbsp; And yet I can hardly conceive so much power
without immediate and sensible effects: only there will be a strong
disposition to resist on the part of all hollow-hearted professors of
religion, whose heathenisms you so unsparingly expose.&nbsp; They have
a class feeling like others.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To the young, and to those who do not reflect much on what
is offered to their belief, you will do great good by showing how spiritual
food is often adulterated.&nbsp; The bread from heaven is in the same
case as bakers&rsquo; bread.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If there is truth in what I heard Lord Byron say, that works
of fiction live only by the amount of truth which they contain, your
story is sure of a long life.&nbsp; Of the few critiques I have seen,
the best is in &ldquo;The Examiner.&rdquo;&nbsp; I find an obtuseness
as to the spirit and aim of the book, as if you had designed to make
the best novel of the season, or to keep up the reputation of one.&nbsp;
You are reproached, as Walter Scott was, with too much scriptural quotation;
not, that I have heard, with phrases of an opposite character.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The effects of such reading till a late hour one evening appeared
to influence me very singularly in a dream.&nbsp; The most horrible
spectres presented themselves, and I woke in an agony of fear; but a
faith still stronger arose, and I became courageous from trust in God,
and felt calm.&nbsp; Did you do this?&nbsp; It is very insignificant
among the many things you certainly will do unknown to yourself.&nbsp;
I know more than ever before how to value communion with you.&nbsp;
I have sent Robertson&rsquo;s Sermons for you; and, with kind regards
to your family, am</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Yours
affectionately,</p>

<p>I was struck in this note with the mention of Lord Byron, and, the
next time I saw her, alluded to it, and remarked upon the peculiar qualities
of his mind as shown in some of his more serious conversations with
Dr. Kennedy.</p>
<p>She seemed pleased to continue the subject, and went on to say many
things of his singular character and genius, more penetrating and more
appreciative than is often met with among critics.</p>
<p>I told her that I had been from childhood powerfully influenced by
him; and began to tell her how much, as a child, I had been affected
by the news of his death,&mdash;giving up all my plays, and going off
to a lonely hillside, where I spent the afternoon thinking of him.&nbsp;
She interrupted me before I had quite finished, with a quick, impulsive
movement.&nbsp; &lsquo;I know all that,&rsquo; she said: &lsquo;I heard
it all from Mrs. ---; and it was one of the things that made me wish
to <i>know</i> you.&nbsp; I think <i>you</i> could understand him.&rsquo;&nbsp;
We talked for some time of him then; she, with her pale face slightly
flushed, speaking, as any other great man&rsquo;s widow might, only
of what was purest and best in his works, and what were his undeniable
virtues and good traits, especially in early life.&nbsp; She told me
many pleasant little speeches made by him to herself; and, though there
was running through all this a shade of melancholy, one could never
have conjectured that there were under all any deeper recollections
than the circumstances of an ordinary separation might bring.</p>
<p>Not many days after, with the unselfishness which was so marked a
trait with her, she chose a day when she could be out of her room, and
invited our family party, consisting of my husband, sister, and children,
to lunch with her.</p>
<p>What showed itself especially in this interview was her tenderness
for all young people.&nbsp; She had often enquired after mine; asked
about their characters, habits, and tastes; and on this occasion she
found an opportunity to talk with each one separately, and to make them
all feel at ease, so that they were able to talk with her.&nbsp; She
seemed interested to point out to them what they should see and study
in London; and the charm of her conversation left on their minds an
impression that subsequent years have never effaced.&nbsp; I record
this incident, because it shows how little Lady Byron assumed the privileges
or had the character of an invalid absorbed in herself, and likely to
brood over her own woes and wrongs.</p>
<p>Here was a family of strangers stranded in a dull season in London,
and there was no manner of obligation upon her to exert herself to show
them attention.&nbsp; Her state of health would have been an all-sufficient
reason why she should not do it; and her doing it was simply a specimen
of that unselfish care for others, even down to the least detail, of
which her life was full.</p>
<p>A little while after, at her request, I went, with my husband and
son, to pass an evening at her house.</p>
<p>There were a few persons present whom she thought I should be interested
to know,&mdash;a Miss Goldsmid, daughter of Baron Goldsmid, and Lord
Ockham, her grandson, eldest son and heir of the Earl of Lovelace, to
whom she introduced my son.</p>
<p>I had heard much of the eccentricities of this young nobleman, and
was exceedingly struck with his personal appearance.&nbsp; His bodily
frame was of the order of the Farnese Hercules,&mdash;a wonderful development
of physical and muscular strength.&nbsp; His hands were those of a blacksmith.&nbsp;
He was broadly and squarely made, with a finely-shaped head, and dark
eyes of surpassing brilliancy.&nbsp; I have seldom seen a more interesting
combination than his whole appearance presented.</p>
<p>When all were engaged in talking, Lady Byron came and sat down by
me, and glancing across to Lord Ockham and my son, who were talking
together, she looked at me, and smiled.&nbsp; I immediately expressed
my admiration of his fine eyes and the intellectual expression of his
countenance, and my wonder at the uncommon muscular development of his
frame.</p>
<p>She said that <i>that</i> of itself would account for many of Ockham&rsquo;s
eccentricities.&nbsp; He had a body that required a more vigorous animal
life than his station gave scope for, and this had often led him to
seek it in what the world calls low society; that he had been to sea
as a sailor, and was now working as a mechanic on the iron work of &lsquo;The
Great Eastern.&rsquo;&nbsp; He had laid aside his title, and went in
daily with the other workmen, requesting them to call him simply Ockham.</p>
<p>I said that there was something to my mind very fine about this,
even though it might show some want of proper balance.</p>
<p>She said he had noble traits, and that she felt assured he would
yet accomplish something worthy of himself.&nbsp; &lsquo;The great difficulty
with our nobility is apt to be, that they do not <i>understand</i> the
working-classes, so as to feel for them properly; and Ockham is now
going through an experience which may yet fit him to do great good when
he comes to the peerage.&nbsp; I am trying to influence him to do good
among the workmen, and to interest himself in schools for their children.&nbsp;
I think,&rsquo; she added, &lsquo;I have great influence over Ockham,&mdash;the
greater, perhaps, that I never make any claim to authority.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This conversation is very characteristic of Lady Byron as showing
her benevolent analysis of character, and the peculiar hopefulness she
always had in regard to the future of every one brought in connection
with her.&nbsp; Her moral hopefulness was something very singular; and
in this respect she was so different from the rest of the world, that
it would be difficult to make her understood.&nbsp; Her tolerance of
wrong-doing would have seemed to many quite latitudinarian, and impressed
them as if she had lost all just horror of what was morally wrong in
transgression; but it seemed her fixed habit to see faults only as diseases
and immaturities, and to expect them to fall away with time.</p>
<p>She saw the germs of good in what others regarded as only evil.&nbsp;
She expected valuable results to come from what the world looked on
only as eccentricities; <a name="citation147"></a><a href="#footnote147">{147}</a>
and she incessantly devoted herself to the task of guarding those whom
the world condemned, and guiding them to those higher results of which
she often thought that even their faults were prophetic.</p>
<p>Before I quit this sketch of Lady Byron as I knew her, I will give
one more of her letters.&nbsp; My return from that visit in Europe was
met by the sudden death of the son mentioned in the foregoing account.&nbsp;
At the time of this sorrow, Lady Byron was too unwell to write to me.&nbsp;
The letter given alludes to this event, and speaks also of two coloured
persons of remarkable talent, in whose career in England she had taken
a deep interest.&nbsp; One of them is the &lsquo;friend&rsquo; she speaks
of.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;LONDON,
Feb. 6, 1859.</p>
<p>DEAR MRS. STOWE,&mdash;I seem to feel our friend as a bridge, over
which our broken outward communication can be renewed without effort.&nbsp;
Why broken?&nbsp; The words I would have uttered at one time were like
drops of blood from my heart.&nbsp; Now I sympathise with the calmness
you have gained, and can speak of your loss as I do of my own.&nbsp;
Loss and restoration are more and more linked in my mind, but &ldquo;to
the present live.&rdquo;&nbsp; As long as they are in God&rsquo;s world
they are in ours.&nbsp; I ask no other consolation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mrs. W---&rsquo;s recovery has astonished me, and her husband&rsquo;s
prospects give me great satisfaction.&nbsp; They have achieved a benefit
to their coloured people.&nbsp; She had a mission which her burning
soul has worked out, almost in defiance of death.&nbsp; But who is &ldquo;called&rdquo;
without being &ldquo;crucified,&rdquo; man or woman?&nbsp; I know of
none.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I fear that H. Martineau was too sanguine in her persuasion
that the slave power had received a serious check from the ruin of so
many of your Mammon-worshippers.&nbsp; With the return of commercial
facilities, that article of commerce will again find purchasers enough
to raise its value.&nbsp; Not that way is the iniquity to be overthrown.&nbsp;
A deeper moral earthquake is needed. <a name="citation148"></a><a href="#footnote148">{148}</a>&nbsp;
We English had ours in India; and though the cases are far from being
alike, yet a consciousness of what we ought to have been and ought to
be toward the natives could not have been awakened by less than the
reddened waters of the Ganges.&nbsp; So I fear you will have to look
on a day of judgment worse than has been painted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As to all the frauds and impositions which have been disclosed
by the failures, what a want of the sense of personal responsibility
they show.&nbsp; It seems to be thought that &ldquo;association&rdquo;
will &ldquo;cover a multitude of sins;&rdquo; as if &ldquo;and Co.&rdquo;
could enter heaven.&nbsp; A firm may be described as a partnership for
lowering the standard of morals.&nbsp; Even ecclesiastical bodies are
not free from the &ldquo;and Co.;&rdquo; very different from &ldquo;the
goodly fellowship of the apostles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The better class of young gentlemen in England are seized
with a mediaeval mania, to which Ruskin has contributed much.&nbsp;
The chief reason for regretting it is that taste is made to supersede
benevolence.&nbsp; The money that would save thousands from perishing
or suffering must be applied to raise the Gothic edifice where their
last prayer may be uttered.&nbsp; Charity may be dead, while Art has
glorified her.&nbsp; This is worse than Catholicism, which cultivates
heart and eye together.&nbsp; The first cathedral was Truth, at the
beginning of the fourth century, just as Christianity was exchanging
a heavenly for an earthly crown.&nbsp; True religion may have to cast
away the symbol for the spirit before &ldquo;the kingdom&rdquo; can
come.</p>
<p>&lsquo;While I am speculating to little purpose, perhaps you are
doing&mdash;what?&nbsp; Might not a biography from your pen bring forth
again some great, half-obscured soul to act on the world?&nbsp; Even
Sir Philip Sidney ought to be superseded by a still nobler type.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This must go immediately, to be in time for the bearer, of
whose meeting with you I shall think as the friend of both.&nbsp; May
it be happy!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Your

<p>One letter more from Lady Byron I give,&mdash;the last I received
from her:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LONDON,
May 3, 1859.</p>
<p>DEAR FRIEND,&mdash;I have found, particularly as to yourself, that,
if I did not answer from the first impulse, all had evaporated.&nbsp;
Your letter came by &lsquo;The Niagara,&rsquo; which brought Fanny Kemble
to learn the loss of her best friend, the Miss F---- whom you saw at
my house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her death, after an illness in which she was to the last a
minister of good to others, is a soul-loss to me also; and your remarks
are most appropriate to my feelings.&nbsp; I have been taught, however,
to accept survivorship; even to feel it, in some cases, Heaven&rsquo;s
best blessing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have an intense interest in your new novel. <a name="citation149"></a><a href="#footnote149">{149}</a>&nbsp;
More power in these few numbers than in any of your former writings,
relating, at least, to my own mind.&nbsp; It would amuse you to hear
my granddaughter and myself attempting to foresee the future of the
love-story; being, for the moment, quite persuaded that James is at
sea, and the minister about to ruin himself.&nbsp; We think that Mary
will labour to be in love with the self-devoted man, under her mother&rsquo;s
influence, and from that hyper-conscientiousness so common with good
girls; but we don&rsquo;t wish her to succeed.&nbsp; Then what is to
become of her older lover?&nbsp; Time will show.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The lady you desired to introduce to me will be welcomed as
of you.&nbsp; She has been misled with respect to my having any house
in Yorkshire (New Leeds).&nbsp; I am in London now to be of a little
use to A----; not ostensibly, for I can neither go out, nor give parties:
but I am the confidential friend to whom she likes to bring her social
gatherings, as she can see something of the world with others.&nbsp;
Age and infirmity seem to be overlooked in what she calls the harmony
between us,&mdash;not perfect agreement of opinion (which I should regret,
with almost fifty years of difference), but the spirit-union: can you
say what it is?</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am interrupted by a note from Mrs. K----.&nbsp; She says
that she cannot write of our lost friend yet, though she is less sad
than she will be.&nbsp; Mrs. F---- may like to hear of her arrival,
should you be in communication with our friend.&nbsp; She is the type
of youth in age.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I often converse with Miss S----, a judicious friend of the
W----s, about what is likely to await them.&nbsp; She would not succeed
here as well as where she was a novelty.&nbsp; The character of our
climate this year has been injurious to the respiratory organs; but
I hope still to serve them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have just missed Dale Owen, with whom I wished to have conversed
on spiritualism. <a name="citation150"></a><a href="#footnote150">{150}</a>&nbsp;
Harris is lecturing here on religion.&nbsp; I do not hear him praised.</p>
<p>&lsquo;People are looking for helps to believe, everywhere but in
life,&mdash;in music, in architecture, in antiquity, in ceremony; and
upon all these is written, &ldquo;Thou shalt not believe.&rdquo;&nbsp;
At least, if this be faith, happier the unbeliever.&nbsp; I am willing
to see through that materialism; but, if I am to rest there, I would
rend the veil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;June
1.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The day of the packet&rsquo;s sailing.&nbsp; I shall hope
to be visited by you here.&nbsp; The best flowers sent me have been
placed in your little vases, giving life to the remembrance of you,
though not, like them, to pass away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Ever

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;A.
I. NOEL BYRON.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shortly after, I was in England again, and had one more opportunity
of resuming our personal intercourse.&nbsp; The first time that I called
on Lady Byron, I saw her in one of those periods of utter physical exhaustion
to which she was subject on account of the constant pressure of cares
beyond her strength.&nbsp; All who knew her will testify, that, in a
state of health which would lead most persons to become helpless absorbents
of service from others, she was assuming burdens, and making outlays
of her vital powers in acts of love and service, with a generosity that
often reduced her to utter exhaustion.&nbsp; But none who knew or loved
her ever misinterpreted the coldness of those seasons of exhaustion.&nbsp;
We knew that it was not the spirit that was chilled, but only the frail
mortal tabernacle.&nbsp; When I called on her at this time, she could
not see me at first; and when, at last, she came, it was evident that
she was in a state of utter prostration.&nbsp; Her hands were like ice;
her face was deadly pale; and she conversed with a restraint and difficulty
which showed what exertion it was for her to keep up at all.&nbsp; I
left as soon as possible, with an appointment for another interview.&nbsp;
That interview was my last on earth with her, and is still beautiful
in memory.&nbsp; It was a long, still summer afternoon, spent alone
with her in a garden, where we walked together.&nbsp; She was enjoying
one of those bright intervals of freedom from pain and languor, in which
her spirits always rose so buoyant and youthful; and her eye brightened,
and her step became elastic.</p>
<p>One last little incident is cherished as most expressive of her.&nbsp;
When it became time for me to leave, she took me in her carriage to
the station.&nbsp; As we were almost there, I missed my gloves, and
said, &lsquo;I must have left them; but there is not time to go back.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With one of those quick, impulsive motions which were so natural
to her in doing a kindness, she drew off her own and said, &lsquo;Take
mine if they will serve you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I hesitated a moment; and then the thought, that I might never see
her again, came over me, and I said, &lsquo;Oh, yes! thanks.&rsquo;&nbsp;
That was the last earthly word of love between us.&nbsp; But, thank
God, those who love worthily never meet for the <i>last</i> time: there
is always a future.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II.&nbsp; LADY BYRON&rsquo;S STORY AS TOLD ME.</h3>
<p>I now come to the particulars of that most painful interview which
has been the cause of all this controversy.&nbsp; My sister and myself
were going from London to Eversley to visit the Rev. C. Kingsley.&nbsp;
On our way, we stopped, by Lady Byron&rsquo;s invitation, to lunch with
her at her summer residence on Ham Common, near Richmond; and it was
then arranged, that on our return, we should make her a short visit,
as she said she had a subject of importance on which she wished to converse
with me alone.</p>
<p>On our return from Eversley, we arrived at her house in the morning.</p>
<p>It appeared to be one of Lady Byron&rsquo;s well days.&nbsp; She
was up and dressed, and moved about her house with her usual air of
quiet simplicity; as full of little acts of consideration for all about
her as if they were the habitual invalids, and she the well person.</p>
<p>There were with her two ladies of her most intimate friends, by whom
she seemed to be regarded with a sort of worship.&nbsp; When she left
the room for a moment, they looked after her with a singular expression
of respect and affection, and expressed freely their admiration of her
character, and their fears that her unselfishness might be leading her
to over-exertion.</p>
<p>After lunch, I retired with Lady Byron; and my sister remained with
her friends.&nbsp; I should here remark, that the chief subject of the
conversation which ensued was not entirely new to me.&nbsp; In the interval
between my first and second visits to England, a lady who for many years
had enjoyed Lady Byron&rsquo;s friendship and confidence, had, with
her consent, stated the case generally to me, giving some of the incidents:
so that I was in a manner prepared for what followed.</p>
<p>Those who accuse Lady Byron of being a person fond of talking upon
this subject, and apt to make unconsidered confidences, can have known
very little of her, of her reserve, and of the apparent difficulty she
had in speaking on subjects nearest her heart.</p>
<p>Her habitual calmness and composure of manner, her collected dignity
on all occasions, are often mentioned by her husband, sometimes with
bitterness, sometimes with admiration.&nbsp; He says, &lsquo;Though
I accuse Lady Byron of an excess of self-respect, I must in candour
admit that, if ever a person had excuse for an extraordinary portion
of it, she has; as, in all her thoughts, words, and deeds, she is the
most decorous woman that ever existed, and must appear, what few I fancy
could, a perfectly refined gentlewoman, even to her <i>femme de chambre</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This calmness and dignity were never more manifested than in this
interview.&nbsp; In recalling the conversation at this distance of time,
I cannot remember all the language used.&nbsp; Some particular words
and forms of expression I do remember, and those I give; and in other
cases I give my recollection of the substance of what was said.</p>
<p>There was something awful to me in the intensity of repressed emotion
which she showed as she proceeded.&nbsp; The great fact upon which all
turned was stated in words that were unmistakable:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was guilty of incest with his sister!&rsquo;</p>
<p>She here became so deathly pale, that I feared she would faint; and
hastened to say, &lsquo;My dear friend, I have heard that.&rsquo;&nbsp;
She asked quickly, &lsquo;From whom?&rsquo; and I answered, &lsquo;From
Mrs. ----;&rsquo; when she replied, &lsquo;Oh, yes!&rsquo; as if recollecting
herself.</p>
<p>I then asked her some questions; in reply to which she said, &lsquo;I
will tell you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She then spoke of her first acquaintance with Lord Byron; from which
I gathered that she, an only child, brought up in retirement, and living
much within herself, had been, as deep natures often were, intensely
stirred by his poetry; and had felt a deep interest in him personally,
as one that had the germs of all that is glorious and noble.</p>
<p>When she was introduced to him, and perceived his admiration of herself,
and at last received his offer, although deeply moved, she doubted her
own power to be to him all that a wife should be.&nbsp; She declined
his offer, therefore, but desired to retain his friendship.&nbsp; After
this, as she said, a correspondence ensued, mostly on moral and literary
subjects; and, by this correspondence, her interest in him was constantly
increased.</p>
<p>At last, she said, he sent her a very beautiful letter, offering
himself again.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thought,&rsquo; she added, &lsquo;that
it was sincere, and that I might now show him all I felt.&nbsp; I wrote
just what was in my heart.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Afterwards,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I found in one of his
journals this notice of my letter: &ldquo;A letter from Bell,&mdash;never
rains but it pours.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was through her habitual calm a shade of womanly indignation
as she spoke these words; but it was gone in a moment.&nbsp; I said,
&lsquo;And did he not love you, then?&rsquo;&nbsp; She answered, &lsquo;No,
my dear: he did not love me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, then, did he wish to marry you?&rsquo;&nbsp; She laid
her hand on mine, and said in a low voice, &lsquo;You will see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She then told me, that, shortly after the declared engagement, he
came to her father&rsquo;s house to visit her as an accepted suitor.&nbsp;
The visit was to her full of disappointment.&nbsp; His appearance was
so strange, moody, and unaccountable, and his treatment of her so peculiar,
that she came to the conclusion that he did not love her, and sought
an opportunity to converse with him alone.</p>
<p>She told him that she saw from his manner that their engagement did
not give him pleasure; that she should never blame him if he wished
to dissolve it; that his nature was exceptional; and if, on a nearer
view of the situation, he shrank from it, she would release him, and
remain no less than ever his friend.</p>
<p>Upon this, she said, he fainted entirely away.</p>
<p>She stopped a moment, and then, as if speaking with great effort,
added, <i>&lsquo;Then</i> I was <i>sure</i> he must love me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And did he not?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;What other cause
could have led to this emotion?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She looked at me very sadly, and said, &lsquo;<i>Fear of detection</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;did <i>that cause</i> then exist?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;it did.&rsquo;&nbsp; And she
explained that she now attributed Lord Byron&rsquo;s great agitation
to fear, that, in some way, suspicion of the crime had been aroused
in her mind, and that on this account she was seeking to break the engagement.&nbsp;
She said, that, from that moment, her sympathies were aroused for him,
to soothe the remorse and anguish which seemed preying on his mind,
and which she then regarded as the sensibility of an unusually exacting
moral nature, which judged itself by higher standards, and condemned
itself unsparingly for what most young men of his times regarded as
venial faults.&nbsp; She had every hope for his future, and all the
enthusiasm of belief that so many men and women of those times and ours
have had in his intrinsic nobleness.&nbsp; She said the gloom, however,
seemed to be even deeper when he came to the marriage; but she looked
at it as the suffering of a peculiar being, to whom she was called to
minister.&nbsp; I said to her, that, even in the days of my childhood,
I had heard of something very painful that had passed as they were in
the carriage, immediately after marriage.&nbsp; She then said that it
was so; that almost his first words, when they were alone, were, that
she <i>might</i> once have saved him; that, if she had accepted him
when he first offered, she might have made him anything she pleased;
but that, as it was, she would find she had married a devil.</p>
<p>The conversation, as recorded in Lady Anne Barnard&rsquo;s Diary,
seems only a continuation of the foregoing, and just what might have
followed upon it.</p>
<p>I then asked how she became certain of the true cause.</p>
<p>She said, that, from the outset of their married life, his conduct
towards her was strange and unaccountable, even during the first weeks
after the wedding, while they were visiting her friends, and outwardly
on good terms.&nbsp; He seemed resolved to shake and combat both her
religious principles and her views of the family state.&nbsp; He tried
to undermine her faith in Christianity as a rule of life by argument
and by ridicule.&nbsp; He set before her the Continental idea of the
liberty of marriage; it being a simple partnership of friendship and
property, the parties to which were allowed by one another to pursue
their own separate individual tastes.&nbsp; He told her, that, as he
could not be expected to confine himself to her, neither should he expect
or wish that she should confine herself to him; that she was young and
pretty, and could have her lovers, and he should never object; and that
she must allow him the same freedom.</p>
<p>She said that she did not comprehend to what this was tending till
after they came to London, and his sister came to stay with them.</p>
<p>At what precise time the idea of an improper connection between her
husband and his sister was first forced upon her, she did not say; but
she told me how it was done.&nbsp; She said that one night, in her presence,
he treated his sister with a liberty which both shocked and astonished
her.&nbsp; Seeing her amazement and alarm, he came up to her, and said,
in a sneering tone, &lsquo;I suppose you perceive <i>you</i> are not
wanted here.&nbsp; Go to your own room, and leave us alone.&nbsp; We
can amuse ourselves better without you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She said, &lsquo;I went to my room, trembling.&nbsp; I fell down
on my knees, and prayed to my heavenly Father to have mercy on them.&nbsp;
I thought, &ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>I remember, after this, a pause in the conversation, during which
she seemed struggling with thoughts and emotions; and, for my part,
I was unable to utter a word, or ask a question.</p>
<p>She did not tell me what followed immediately upon this, nor how
soon after she spoke on the subject with either of the parties.&nbsp;
She first began to speak of conversations afterwards held with Lord
Byron, in which he boldly avowed the connection as having existed in
time past, and as one that was to continue in time to come; and implied
that she must submit to it.&nbsp; She put it to his conscience as concerning
his sister&rsquo;s soul, and he said that it was no sin, that it was
the way the world was first peopled: the Scriptures taught that all
the world descended from one pair; and how could that be unless brothers
married their sisters? that, if not a sin then, it could not be a sin
now.</p>
<p>I immediately said, &lsquo;Why, Lady Byron, those are the very arguments
given in the drama of &ldquo;Cain.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The very same,&rsquo; was her reply.&nbsp; &lsquo;He could
reason very speciously on this subject.&rsquo;&nbsp; She went on to
say, that, when she pressed him hard with the universal sentiment of
mankind as to the horror and the crime, he took another turn, and said
that the horror and crime were the very attraction; that he had worn
out all <i>ordinary</i> forms of sin, and that he <i>&lsquo;longed for
the stimulus of a new kind of vice</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; She set before
him the dread of detection; and then he became furious.&nbsp; She should
never be the means of his detection, he said.&nbsp; She should leave
him; <i>that</i> he was resolved upon: but she should always bear all
the blame of the separation.&nbsp; In the sneering tone which was common
with him, he said, &lsquo;The world will believe me, and it will <i>not</i>
believe you.&nbsp; The world has made up its mind that &ldquo;By&rdquo;
is a glorious boy; and the world will go for &ldquo;By,&rdquo; right
or wrong.&nbsp; Besides, I shall make it my life&rsquo;s object to discredit
you: I shall use all my powers.&nbsp; Read &ldquo;Caleb Williams,&rdquo;
<a name="citation161"></a><a href="#footnote161">{161}</a> and you will
see that I shall do by you just as Falkland did by Caleb.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I said that all this seemed to me like insanity.&nbsp; She said that
she was for a time led to think that it was insanity, and excused and
pitied him; that his treatment of her expressed such hatred and malignity,
that she knew not what else to think of it; that he seemed resolved
to drive her out of the house at all hazards, and threatened her, if
she should remain, in a way to alarm the heart of any woman: yet, thinking
him insane, she left him at last with the sorrow with which anyone might
leave a dear friend whose reason was wholly overthrown, and to whom
in this desolation she was no longer permitted to minister.</p>
<p>I inquired in one of the pauses of the conversation whether Mrs.
Leigh was a peculiarly beautiful or attractive woman.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, my dear: she was plain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Was she, then, distinguished for genius or talent of any kind?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, no!&nbsp; Poor woman! she was weak, relatively to him,
and wholly under his control.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what became of her?&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She afterwards repented, and became a truly good woman.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I think it was here she mentioned that she had frequently seen and conversed
with Mrs. Leigh in the latter part of her life; and she seemed to derive
comfort from the recollection.</p>
<p>I asked, &lsquo;Was there a child?&rsquo;&nbsp; I had been told by
Mrs. ---- that there was a daughter, who had lived some years.</p>
<p>She said there was one, a daughter, who made her friends much trouble,
being of a very difficult nature to manage.&nbsp; I had understood that
at one time this daughter escaped from her friends to the Continent,
and that Lady Byron assisted in efforts to recover her.&nbsp; Of Lady
Byron&rsquo;s kindness both to Mrs. Leigh and the child, I had before
heard from Mrs. ----, who gave me my first information.</p>
<p>It is also strongly impressed on my mind, that Lady Byron, in answer
to some question of mine as to whether there was ever any meeting between
Lord Byron and his sister after he left England, answered, that she
had insisted upon it, or made it a condition, that Mrs. Leigh should
not go abroad to him.</p>
<p>When the conversation as to events was over, as I stood musing, I
said, &lsquo;Have you no evidence that he repented?&rsquo; and alluded
to the mystery of his death, and the message be endeavoured to utter.</p>
<p>She answered quickly, and with great decision, that whatever might
have been his meaning at that hour, she felt sure he had finally repented;
and added with great earnestness, &lsquo;I do not believe that <i>any</i>
child of the heavenly Father is ever left to eternal sin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I said that such a hope was most delightful to my feelings, but that
I had always regarded the indulgence of it as a dangerous one.</p>
<p>Her look, voice, and manner, at that moment, are indelibly fixed
in my mind.&nbsp; She looked at me so sadly, so firmly, and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Danger, Mrs. Stowe!&nbsp; What danger can come from indulging
that hope, like the danger that comes from not having it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I said in my turn, &lsquo;What danger comes from not having it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The danger of losing all faith in God,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;all
hope for others, all strength to try and save them.&nbsp; I once knew
a lady,&rsquo; she added, &lsquo;who was in a state of scepticism and
despair from belief in that doctrine.&nbsp; I think I saved her by giving
her my faith.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was silent; and she continued: &lsquo;Lord Byron believed in eternal
punishment fully: for though he reasoned against Christianity as it
is commonly received, he could not reason himself out of it; and I think
it made him desperate.&nbsp; He used to say, &ldquo;The worst of it
is I <i>do</i> believe.&rdquo;&nbsp; Had he seen God as I see him, I
am sure his heart would have relented.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She went on to say, that his sins, great as they were, admitted of
much palliation and excuse; that he was the child of singular and ill-matched
parents; that he had an organisation originally fine, but one capable
equally of great good or great evil; that in his childhood he had only
the worst and most fatal influences; that he grew up into manhood with
no guide; that there was everything in the classical course of the schools
to develop an unhealthy growth of passion, and no moral influence of
any kind to restrain it; that the manners of his day were corrupt; that
what were now considered vices in society were then spoken of as matters
of course among young noblemen; that drinking, gaming, and licentiousness
everywhere abounded and that, up to a certain time, he was no worse
than multitudes of other young men of his day,&mdash;only that the vices
of his day were worse for him.&nbsp; The excesses of passion, the disregard
of physical laws in eating, drinking, and living, wrought effects on
him that they did not on less sensitively organised frames, and prepared
him for the evil hour when he fell into the sin which shaded his whole
life.&nbsp; All the rest was a struggle with its consequences,&mdash;sinning
more and more to conceal the sin of the past.&nbsp; But she believed
he never outlived remorse; that he always suffered; and that this showed
that God had not utterly forsaken him.&nbsp; Remorse, she said, always
showed moral sensibility, and, while <i>that</i> remained, there was
always hope.</p>
<p>She now began to speak of her grounds for thinking it might be her
duty fully to publish this story before she left the world.</p>
<p>First she said that, through the whole course of her life, she had
felt the eternal value of truth, and seen how dreadful a thing was falsehood,
and how fearful it was to be an accomplice in it, even by silence.&nbsp;
Lord Byron had demoralised the moral sense of England, and he had done
it in a great degree by the sympathy excited by falsehood.&nbsp; This
had been pleaded in extenuation of all his crimes and vices, and led
to a lowering of the standard of morals in the literary world.&nbsp;
Now it was proposed to print cheap editions of his works, and sell them
among the common people, and interest them in him by the circulation
of this same story.</p>
<p>She then said in effect, that she believed in retribution and suffering
in the future life, and that the consequences of sins <i>here</i> follow
us <i>there</i>; and it was strongly impressed upon her mind that Lord
Byron must suffer in looking on the evil consequences of what he had
done in this life, and in seeing the further extension of that evil.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It has sometimes strongly appeared to me,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;that he cannot be at peace until this injustice has been righted.&nbsp;
Such is the strong feeling that I have when I think of going where he
is.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These things, she said, had led her to inquire whether it might not
be her duty to make a full and clear disclosure before she left the
world.</p>
<p>Of course, I did not listen to this story as one who was investigating
its worth.&nbsp; I received it as truth.&nbsp; And the purpose for which
it was communicated was not to enable me to prove it to the world, but
to ask my opinion whether <i>she</i> should show it to the world before
leaving it.&nbsp; The whole consultation was upon the assumption that
she had at her command such proofs as could not be questioned.</p>
<p>Concerning what they were I did not minutely inquire: only, in answer
to a general question, she said that she had letters and documents in
proof of her story.&nbsp; Knowing Lady Byron&rsquo;s strength of mind,
her clear-headedness, her accurate habits, and her perfect knowledge
of the matter, I considered her judgment on this point decisive.</p>
<p>I told her that I would take the subject into consideration, and
give my opinion in a few days.&nbsp; That night, after my sister and
myself had retired to our own apartment, I related to her the whole
history, and we spent the night in talking of it.&nbsp; I was powerfully
impressed with the justice and propriety of an immediate disclosure;
while she, on the contrary, represented the painful consequences that
would probably come upon Lady Byron from taking such a step.</p>
<p>Before we parted the next day, I requested Lady Byron to give me
some memoranda of such dates and outlines of the general story as would
enable me better to keep it in its connection; which she did.</p>
<p>On giving me the paper, Lady Byron requested me to return it to her
when it had ceased to be of use to me for the purpose indicated.</p>
<p>Accordingly, a day or two after, I enclosed it to her in a hasty
note, as I was then leaving London for Paris, and had not yet had time
fully to consider the subject.</p>
<p>On reviewing my note, I can recall that then the whole history appeared
to me like one of those singular cases where unnatural impulses to vice
are the result of a taint of constitutional insanity.&nbsp; This has
always seemed to me the only way of accounting for instances of utterly
motiveless and abnormal wickedness and cruelty.&nbsp; These my first
impressions were expressed in the hasty note written at the time:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;LONDON,
Nov. 5, 1856.</p>
<p>&lsquo;DEAREST FRIEND,&mdash;I return these.&nbsp; They have held
mine eyes waking!&nbsp; How strange! how unaccountable!&nbsp; Have you
ever subjected the facts to the judgment of a medical man learned in
nervous pathology?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it not insanity?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great wits to madness nearly are allied,<br />
And thin partitions do their bounds divide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But my purpose to-night is not to write you fully what I think
of this matter.&nbsp; I am going to write to you from Paris more at
leisure.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rest of the letter was taken up in the final details of a charity
in which Lady Byron had been engaged with me in assisting an unfortunate
artist.&nbsp; It concludes thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I write now in all haste, en route for Paris.&nbsp;
As to America, all is not lost yet. <a name="citation168"></a><a href="#footnote168">{168}</a>&nbsp;
Farewell!&nbsp; I love you, my dear friend, as never before, with an
intense feeling I cannot easily express.&nbsp; God bless you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;H.
B. S.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next letter is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Paris,
Dec. 17, 1856.</p>
<p>&lsquo;DEAR LADY BYRON,&mdash;The Kansas Committee have written me
a letter desiring me to express to Miss ---- their gratitude for the
five pounds she sent them.&nbsp; I am not personally acquainted with
her, and must return these acknowledgments through you.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I wrote you a day or two since, enclosing the reply of the
Kansas Committee to you.</p>
<p>&lsquo;On that subject on which you spoke to me the last time we
were together, I have thought often and deeply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have changed my mind somewhat.&nbsp; Considering the peculiar
circumstances of the case, I could wish that the sacred veil of silence,
so bravely thrown over the past, should never be withdrawn during the
time that you remain with us.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I would say, then, Leave all with some discreet friends, who,
after both have passed from earth, shall say what was due to justice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am led to think this by seeing how low, how unjust, how
unworthy, the judgments of this world are; and I would not that what
I so much respect, love, and revere should be placed within reach of
its harpy claw, which pollutes what it touches.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The day will yet come which will bring to light every hidden
thing.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed,
neither hid that shall not be known;&rdquo; and so justice will not
fail.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such, my dear friend, are my thoughts; different from what
they were since first I heard that strange, sad history.&nbsp; Meanwhile,
I love you ever, whether we meet again on earth or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Affectionately
yours,</p>

<p>The following letter will here be inserted as confirming a part of
Lady Byron&rsquo;s story:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TO
THE EDITOR OF &lsquo;MACMILLAN&rsquo;S MAGAZINE.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;SIR,&mdash;I trust that you will hold me excused from any
desire to be troublesome, or to rush into print.&nbsp; Both these things
are far from my wish.&nbsp; But the publication of a book having for
its object the vindication of Lord Byron&rsquo;s character, and the
subsequent appearance in your magazine of Mrs. Stowe&rsquo;s article
in defence of Lady Byron, having led to so much controversy in the various
newspapers of the day, I feel constrained to put in a few words among
the rest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My father was intimately acquainted with Lady Byron&rsquo;s
family for many years, both before and after her marriage; being, in
fact, steward to Sir Ralph Milbanke at Seaham, where the marriage took
place; and, from all my recollections of what he told me of the affair
(and he used often to talk of it, up to the time of his death, eight
years ago), I fully agree with Mrs. Stowe&rsquo;s view of the case,
and desire to add my humble testimony to the truth of what she has stated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whilst Byron was staying at Seaham, previous to his marriage,
he spent most of his time pistol-shooting in the plantations adjoining
the hall, often making use of his glove as a mark; his servant being
with him to load for him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When all was in readiness for the wedding-ceremony (which
took place in the drawing-room of the hall), Byron had to be sought
for in the grounds, where he was walking in his usual surly mood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;After the marriage, they posted to Halnaby Lodge in Yorkshire,
a distance of about forty miles; to which place my father accompanied
them, and he always spoke strongly of Lady Byron&rsquo;s apparent distress
during and at the end of the journey.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The insulting words mentioned by Mrs. Stowe were spoken by
Byron before leaving the park at Seaham; after which he appeared to
sit in moody silence, reading a book, for the rest of the journey.&nbsp;
At Halnaby, a number of persons, tenants and others, were met to cheer
them on their arrival.&nbsp; Of these he took not the slightest notice,
but jumped out of the carriage, and walked away, leaving his bride to
alight by herself.&nbsp; She shook hands with my father, and begged
that he would see that some refreshment was supplied to those who had
thus come to welcome them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have in my possession several letters (which I should be
glad to show to anyone interested in the matter) both from Lady Byron,
and her mother, Lady Milbanke, to my father, all showing the deep and
kind interest which they took in the welfare of all connected with them,
and directing the distribution of various charities, etc.&nbsp; Pensions
were allowed both to the old servants of the Milbankes and to several
poor persons in the village and neighbourhood for the rest of their
lives; and Lady Byron never ceased to take a lively interest in all
that concerned them.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I desire to tender my humble thanks to Mrs. Stowe for having
come forward in defence of one whose character has been much misrepresented;
and to you, sir, for having published the same in your pages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I
have the honour to be, sir, yours obediently,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;G.

<h3>CHAPTER III.&nbsp; CHRONOLOGICAL SUMMARY OF EVENTS.</h3>
<p>I have now fulfilled as conscientiously as possible the requests
of those who feel that they have a right to know exactly what was said
in this interview.</p>
<p>It has been my object, in doing this, to place myself just where
I should stand were I giving evidence under oath before a legal tribunal.&nbsp;
In my first published account, there were given some smaller details
of the story, of no particular value to the main purpose of it, which
I received <i>not</i> from Lady Byron, but from her confidential friend.&nbsp;
One of these was the account of her seeing Lord Byron&rsquo;s favourite
spaniel lying at his door, and the other was the scene of the parting.</p>
<p>The first was communicated to me before I ever saw Lady Byron, and
under these circumstances:&mdash;I was invited to meet her, and had
expressed my desire to do so, because Lord Byron had been all my life
an object of great interest to me.&nbsp; I inquired what sort of a person
Lady Byron was.&nbsp; My friend spoke of her with enthusiasm.&nbsp;
I then said, &lsquo;but of course she never <i>loved</i> Lord Byron,
or she would not have left him.&rsquo;&nbsp; The lady answered, &lsquo;I
can show you with what feelings she left him by relating this story;&rsquo;
and then followed the anecdote.</p>
<p>Subsequently, she also related to me the other story of the parting-scene
between Lord and Lady Byron.&nbsp; In regard to these two incidents,
my recollection is clear.</p>
<p>It will be observed by the reader that Lady Byron&rsquo;s conversation
with me was simply for consultation <i>on one point</i>, and that point
whether <i>she herself</i> should publish the story before her death.&nbsp;
It was not, therefore, a complete history of all the events in their
order, but specimens of a few incidents and facts.&nbsp; Her object
was, not to prove her story to me, nor to put me in possession of it
with a view to <i>my</i> proving it, but simply and briefly to show
me <i>what it was</i>, that I might judge as to the probable results
of its publication at that time.</p>
<p>It therefore comprised primarily these points:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; An exact statement, in so many words, of the crime.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A statement of the manner in which it was first forced on
her attention by Lord Byron&rsquo;s words and actions, including his
admissions and defences of it.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The admission of a period when she had ascribed his whole
conduct to insanity.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; A reference to later positive evidences of guilt, the existence
of a child, and Mrs. Leigh&rsquo;s subsequent repentance.</p>
<p>And here I have a word to say in reference to the alleged inaccuracies
of my true story.</p>
<p>The dates that Lady Byron gave me on the memoranda did not relate
either to the time of the first disclosure, or the period when her doubts
became certainties; nor did her conversation touch either of these points:
and, on a careful review of the latter, I see clearly that it omitted
dwelling upon anything which I might be supposed to have learned from
her already published statement.</p>
<p>I re-enclosed that paper to her from London, and have never seen
it since.</p>
<p>In writing my account, which I designed to do in the most general
terms, I took for my guide Miss Martineau&rsquo;s published Memoir of
Lady Byron, which has long stood uncontradicted before the public, of
which Macmillan&rsquo;s London edition is now before me.&nbsp; The reader
is referred to page 316, which reads thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She was born 1792; married in January 1814; returned to her
father&rsquo;s house in 1816; died on May 16, 1860.&rsquo;&nbsp; This
makes her married life two years; but we need not say that the date
is inaccurate, as Lady Byron was married in 1815.</p>
<p>Supposing Lady Byron&rsquo;s married life to have covered two years,
I could only reconcile its continuance for that length of time to her
uncertainty as to his sanity; to deceptions practised on her, making
her doubt at one time, and believe at another; and his keeping her in
a general state of turmoil and confusion, till at last he took the step
of banishing her.</p>
<p>Various other points taken from Miss Martineau have also been attacked
as inaccuracies; for example, the number of executions in the house:
but these points, though of no importance, are substantially borne out
by Moore&rsquo;s statements.</p>
<p>This controversy, unfortunately, cannot be managed with the accuracy
of a legal trial.&nbsp; Its course, hitherto, has rather resembled the
course of a drawing-room scandal, where everyone freely throws in an
assertion, with or without proof.&nbsp; In making out my narrative,
however, I shall use only certain authentic sources, some of which have
for a long time been before the public, and some of which have floated
up from the waves of the recent controversy.&nbsp; I consider as authentic
sources,&mdash;</p>
<p>Moore&rsquo;s Life of Byron;</p>
<p>Lady Byron&rsquo;s own account of the separation, published in 1830;</p>
<p>Lady Byron&rsquo;s statements to me in 1856;</p>
<p>Lord Lindsay&rsquo;s communication, giving an extract from Lady Anne
Barnard&rsquo;s diary, and a copy of a letter from Lady Byron dated
1818, about three years after her marriage;</p>
<p>Mrs. Mimms&rsquo; testimony, as given in a daily paper published
at Newcastle, England;</p>
<p>And Lady Byron&rsquo;s letters, as given recently in the late &lsquo;London
Quarterly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All which documents appear to arrange themselves into a connected
series.</p>
<p>From these, then, let us construct the story.</p>
<p>According to Mrs. Mimms&rsquo; account, which is likely to be accurate,
the time spent by Lord and Lady Byron in bridal-visiting was three weeks
at Halnaby Hall, and six weeks at Seaham, when Mrs. Mimms quitted their
service.</p>
<p>During this first period of three weeks, Lord Byron&rsquo;s treatment
of his wife, as testified to by the servant, was such that she advised
her young mistress to return to her parents; and, at one time, Lady
Byron had almost resolved to do so.</p>
<p>What the particulars of his conduct were, the servant refuses to
state; being bound by a promise of silence to her mistress.&nbsp; She,
however, testifies to a warm friendship existing between Lady Byron
and Mrs. Leigh, in a manner which would lead us to feel that Lady Byron
received and was received by Lord Byron&rsquo;s sister with the greatest
affection.&nbsp; Lady Byron herself says to Lady Anne Barnard, &lsquo;I
had heard that he was the best of brothers;&rsquo; and the inference
is, that she, at an early period of her married life, felt the greatest
confidence in his sister, and wished to have her with them as much as
possible.&nbsp; In Lady Anne&rsquo;s account, this wish to have the
sister with her was increased by Lady Byron&rsquo;s distress at her
husband&rsquo;s attempts to corrupt her principles with regard to religion
and marriage.</p>
<p>In Moore&rsquo;s Life, vol. iii., letter 217, Lord Byron writes from
Seaham to Moore, under date of March 8, sending a copy of his verses
in Lady Byron&rsquo;s handwriting, and saying, &lsquo;We shall leave
this place to-morrow, and shall stop on our way to town, in the interval
of taking a house there, at Colonel Leigh&rsquo;s, near Newmarket, where
any epistle of yours will find its welcome way.&nbsp; I have been very
comfortable here, listening to that d---d monologue which elderly gentlemen
call conversation, in which my pious father-in-law repeats himself every
evening, save one, when he played upon the fiddle.&nbsp; However, they
have been vastly kind and hospitable, and I like them and the place
vastly; and I hope they will live many happy months.&nbsp; Bell is in
health and unvaried good-humour and behaviour; but we are in all the
agonies of packing and parting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nine days after this, under date of March 17, Lord Byron says, &lsquo;We
mean to metropolize to-morrow, and you will address your next to Piccadilly.&rsquo;&nbsp;
The inference is, that the days intermediate were spent at Colonel Leigh&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
The next letters, and all subsequent ones for six months, are dated
from Piccadilly.</p>
<p>As we have shown, there is every reason to believe that a warm friendship
had thus arisen between Mrs. Leigh and Lady Byron, and that, during
all this time, Lady Byron desired as much of the society of her sister-in-law
as possible.&nbsp; She was a married woman and a mother, her husband&rsquo;s
nearest relative; and Lady Byron could with more propriety ask, from
her, counsel or aid in respect to his peculiarities than she could from
her own parents.&nbsp; If we consider the character of Lady Byron as
given by Mrs. Mimms, that of a young person of warm but repressed feeling,
without sister or brother, longing for human sympathy, and having so
far found no relief but in talking with a faithful dependant,&mdash;we
may easily see that the acquisition of a sister through Lord Byron might
have been all in all to her, and that the feelings which he checked
and rejected for himself might have flowed out towards his sister with
enthusiasm.&nbsp; The date of Mrs. Leigh&rsquo;s visit does not appear.</p>
<p>The first domestic indication in Lord Byron&rsquo;s letters from
London is the announcement of the death of Lady Byron&rsquo;s uncle,
Lord Wentworth, from whom came large expectations of property.&nbsp;
Lord Byron had mentioned him before in his letters as so kind to Bell
and himself that he could not find it in his heart to wish him in heaven
if he preferred staying here.&nbsp; In his letter of April 23, he mentions
going to the play immediately after hearing this news, &lsquo;although,&rsquo;
as he says, &lsquo;he ought to have stayed at home in sackcloth for
&ldquo;unc.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>On June 12, he writes that Lady Byron is more than three months advanced
in her progress towards maternity; and that they have been out very
little, as he wishes to keep her quiet.&nbsp; We are informed by Moore
that Lord Byron was at this time a member of the Drury-Lane Theatre
Committee; and that, in this unlucky connection, one of the fatalities
of the first year of trial as a husband lay.&nbsp; From the strain of
Byron&rsquo;s letters, as given in Moore, it is apparent, that, while
he thinks it best for his wife to remain at home, he does not propose
to share the retirement, but prefers running his own separate career
with such persons as thronged the greenroom of the theatre in those
days.</p>
<p>In commenting on Lord Byron&rsquo;s course, we must not by any means
be supposed to indicate that he was doing any more or worse than most
gay young men of his time.&nbsp; The licence of the day as to getting
drunk at dinner-parties, and leading, generally, what would, in these
days, be called a disorderly life, was great.&nbsp; We should infer
that none of the literary men of Byron&rsquo;s time would have been
ashamed of being drunk occasionally.&nbsp; The Noctes Ambrosianae Club
of &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; is full of songs glorying, in the broadest
terms, in out-and-out drunkenness, and inviting to it as the highest
condition of a civilised being. <a name="citation178a"></a><a href="#footnote178a">{178a}</a></p>
<p>But drunkenness upon Lord Byron had a peculiar and specific effect,
which he notices afterwards, in his Journal, at Venice: &lsquo;The effect
of all wines and spirits upon me is, however, strange.&nbsp; It settles,
but makes me gloomy&mdash;gloomy at the very moment of their effect:
it composes, however, though <i>sullenly</i>.&rsquo; <a name="citation178b"></a><a href="#footnote178b">{178b}</a>&nbsp;
And, again, in another place, he says, &lsquo;Wine and spirits make
me sullen, and savage to ferocity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is well known that the effects of alcoholic excitement are various
as the natures of the subjects.&nbsp; But by far the worst effects,
and the most destructive to domestic peace, are those that occur in
cases where spirits, instead of acting on the nerves of motion, and
depriving the subject of power in that direction, stimulate the brain
so as to produce there the ferocity, the steadiness, the utter deadness
to compassion or conscience, which characterise a madman.&nbsp; How
fearful to a sensitive young mother in the period of pregnancy might
be the return of such a madman to the domestic roof!&nbsp; Nor can we
account for those scenes described in Lady Anne Barnard&rsquo;s letters,
where Lord Byron returned from his evening parties to try torturing
experiments on his wife, otherwise than by his own statement, that spirits,
while they <i>steadied</i> him, made him &lsquo;gloomy, and savage to
ferocity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Take for example this:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;One night, coming home from one of his lawless
parties, he saw me (Lady B.) so indignantly collected, and bearing all
with such a determined calmness, that a rush of remorse seemed to come
over him.&nbsp; He called himself a monster, and, though his sister
was present, threw himself in agony at my feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could
not, no, I could not, forgive him such injuries!&nbsp; He had lost me
forever!&rdquo;&nbsp; Astonished at this return to virtue, my tears,
I believe, flowed over his face; and I said, &ldquo;Byron, all is forgotten;
never, never shall you hear of it more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He started up, and folding his arms while he looked at me,
burst out into laughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only a philosophical experiment; that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wished to ascertain the value of your resolutions.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To ascribe such deliberate cruelty as this to the effect of drink
upon Lord Byron, is the most charitable construction that can be put
upon his conduct.</p>
<p>Yet the manners of the period were such, that Lord Byron must have
often come to this condition while only doing what many of his acquaintances
did freely, and without fear of consequences.</p>
<p>Mr. Moore, with his usual artlessness, gives us an idea of a private
supper between himself and Lord Byron.&nbsp; We give it, with our own
italics, as a specimen of many others:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Having taken upon me to order the repast, and
knowing that Lord Byron for the last two days had done nothing towards
sustenance beyond eating a few biscuits and (to appease appetite) chewing
mastic, I desired that we should have a good supply of at least two
kinds of fish.&nbsp; My companion, however, confined himself to lobsters;
and of these finished two or three, to his own share, interposing, sometimes,
a small liqueur-glass of strong white brandy, sometimes a tumbler of
very hot water, and then pure brandy again, to the amount of near half
a dozen small glasses of the latter, without which, alternately with
the hot water, he appeared to think the lobster could not be digested.&nbsp;
After this, we had claret, of which, having despatched two bottles between
us, at about four o&rsquo;clock in the morning we parted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;As Pope has thought his &ldquo;delicious lobster-nights&rdquo;
worth commemorating, these particulars of one in which Lord Byron was
concerned may also have some interest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Among other nights of the same description which I had the
happiness of passing with him, I remember once, in returning home from
some assembly at rather a late hour, we saw lights in the windows of
his old haunt, Stevens&rsquo;s in Bond Street, and agreed to stop there
and sup.&nbsp; On entering, we found an old friend of his, Sir G----
W----, who joined our party; and, the lobsters and brandy and water
being put in requisition, it was (as usual on such occasions) broad
daylight before we separated.&rsquo;&mdash;Vol. iii. p.83.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the latter part of Lady Byron&rsquo;s pregnancy, it appears
from Moore that Byron was, night after night, engaged out at dinner
parties, in which getting drunk was considered as of course the <i>finale</i>,
as appears from the following letters:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(LETTER
228.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TO
MR. MOORE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;TERRACE,
PICCADILLY, OCT. 31,1815.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have not been able to ascertain precisely the time of duration
of the stock-market; but I believe it is a good time for selling out,
and I hope so.&nbsp; First, because I shall see you; and, next, because
I shall receive certain moneys on behalf of Lady B., the which will
materially conduce to my comfort; I wanting (as the duns say) &ldquo;to
make up a sum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yesterday I dined out with a large-ish party, where were Sheridan
and Colman, Harry Harris, of C. G., and his brother, Sir Gilbert Heathcote,
Ds. Kinnaird, and others of note and notoriety.&nbsp; Like other parties
of the kind, it was first silent, then talky, then argumentative, then
disputatious, then unintelligible, * then altogethery, then inarticulate,
and then drunk.&nbsp; When we had reached the last step of this glorious
ladder, it was difficult to get down again without stumbling; and, to
crown all, Kinnaird and I had to conduct Sheridan down a d---d corkscrew
staircase, which had certainly been constructed before the discovery
of fermented liquors, and to which no legs, however crooked, could possibly
accommodate themselves.&nbsp; We deposited him safe at home, where his
man, evidently used to the business, <a name="citation181"></a><a href="#footnote181">{181}</a>
waited to receive him in the hall.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Both he and Colman were, as usual, very good; but I carried
away much wine, and the wine had previously carried away my memory:
so that all was hiccough and happiness for the last hour or so, and
I am not impregnated with any of the conversation.&nbsp; Perhaps you
heard of a late answer of Sheridan to the watchman who found him bereft
of that &ldquo;divine particle of air&rdquo; called reason . . . He
(the watchman) found Sherry in the street fuddled and bewildered, and
almost insensible.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who are you, sir?&rdquo;&mdash;No answer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;&mdash;A hiccough.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
your name?&rdquo;&mdash;Answer, in a slow, deliberate, and impassive
tone, &ldquo;Wilberforce!&rdquo;&nbsp; Is not that Sherry all over?&mdash;and,
to my mind, excellent.&nbsp; Poor fellow, his very dregs are better
than the &ldquo;first sprightly runnings&rdquo; of others.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My paper is full, and I have a grievous headache.</p>
<p>&lsquo;P.S.&mdash;Lady B. is in full progress.&nbsp; Next month will
bring to light (with the aid of &ldquo;Juno Lucina, fer opem,&rdquo;
or rather opes, for the last are most wanted) the tenth wonder of the
world; Gil Blas being the eighth, and he (my son&rsquo;s father) the
ninth.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we have a picture of the whole story,&mdash;Lady Byron within
a month of her confinement; her money being used to settle debts; her
husband out at a dinner-party, going through the <i>usual course</i>
of such parties, able to keep his legs and help Sheridan downstairs,
and going home &lsquo;gloomy, and savage to ferocity,&rsquo; to his
wife.</p>
<p>Four days after this (letter 229), we find that this dinner-party
is not an exceptional one, but one of a series: for he says, &lsquo;To-day
I dine with Kinnaird,&mdash;we are to have Sheridan and Colman again;
and to-morrow, once more, at Sir Gilbert Heathcote&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Afterward, in Venice, he reviews the state of his health, at this
period in London; and his account shows that his excesses in the vices
of his times had wrought effects on his sensitive, nervous organisation,
very different from what they might on the more phlegmatic constitutions
of ordinary Englishmen.&nbsp; In his journal, dated Venice, Feb. 2,
1821, he says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I have been considering what can be the reason
why I always wake at a certain hour in the morning, and always in very
bad spirits,&mdash;I may say, in actual despair and despondency, in
all respects, even of that which pleased me over night.&nbsp; In about
an hour or two this goes off, and I compose either to sleep again, or
at least to quiet.&nbsp; In England, five years ago, I had the same
kind of hypochondria, but accompanied with so violent a thirst, that
I have drunk as many as fifteen bottles of soda-water in one night,
after going to bed, and been still thirsty,&mdash;calculating, however,
some lost from the bursting-out and effervescence and overflowing of
the soda-water in drawing the corks, or striking off the necks of the
bottles from mere thirsty impatience.&nbsp; At present, I have not the
thirst; but the depression of spirits is no less violent.&rsquo;&mdash;Vol.
v. p.96.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These extracts go to show what <i>must</i> have been the condition
of the man whom Lady Byron was called to receive at the intervals when
he came back from his various social excitements and pleasures.&nbsp;
That his nerves were exacerbated by violent extremes of abstinence and
reckless indulgence; that he was often day after day drunk, and that
drunkenness made him savage and ferocious,&mdash;such are the facts
clearly shown by Mr. Moore&rsquo;s narrative.&nbsp; Of the natural peculiarities
of Lord Byron&rsquo;s temper, he thus speaks to the Countess of Blessington:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I often think that I inherit my violence and bad
temper from my poor mother, not that my father, from all I could ever
learn, had a much better; so that it is no wonder I have such a very
bad one.&nbsp; As long as I can remember anything, I recollect being
subject to violent paroxysms of rage, so disproportioned to the cause
as to surprise me when they were over; and this still continues.&nbsp;
I cannot coolly view any thing which excites my feelings; and, once
the lurking devil in me is roused, I lose all command of myself.&nbsp;
I do not recover a good fit of rage for days after.&nbsp; Mind, I do
not by this mean that the ill humour continues, as, on the contrary,
that quickly subsides, exhausted by its own violence; but it shakes
me terribly, and leaves me low and nervous after.&rsquo;&mdash;Lady
Blessington&rsquo;s Conversations, p.142.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That during this time also his irritation and ill temper were increased
by the mortification of duns, debts, and executions, is on the face
of Moore&rsquo;s story.&nbsp; Moore himself relates one incident, which
gives some idea of the many which may have occurred at these times,
in a note on p.215, vol. iv., where he speaks of Lord Byron&rsquo;s
destroying a favourite old watch that had been his companion from boyhood,
and gone with him to Greece.&nbsp; &lsquo;In a fit of vexation and rage,
brought upon him by some of these humiliating embarrassments, to which
he was now almost daily a prey, he furiously dashed this watch on the
hearth, and ground it to pieces with the poker among the ashes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is no wonder, that, with a man of this kind to manage, Lady Byron
should have clung to the only female companionship she could dare to
trust in the case, and earnestly desired to retain with her the sister,
who seemed, more than herself, to have influence over him.</p>
<p>The first letter given by &lsquo;The Quarterly,&rsquo; from Lady
Byron to Mrs. Leigh, without a date, evidently belongs to this period,
when the sister&rsquo;s society presented itself as a refuge in her
approaching confinement.&nbsp; Mrs Leigh speaks of leaving.&nbsp; The
young wife, conscious that the house presents no attractions, and that
soon she herself shall be laid by, cannot urge Mrs. Leigh&rsquo;s stay
as likely to give her any pleasure, but only as a comfort to herself.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;You will think me very foolish; but I have tried
two or three times, and cannot talk to you of your departure with a
decent visage: so let me say one word in this way to spare my philosophy.&nbsp;
With the expectations which I have, I never will nor can ask you to
stay one moment longer than you are inclined to do.&nbsp; It would [be]
the worst return for all I ever received from you.&nbsp; But in this
at least I am &ldquo;truth itself,&rdquo; when I say, that whatever
the situation may be, there is no one whose society is dearer to me,
or can contribute more to my happiness.&nbsp; These feelings will not
change under any circumstances, and I should be grieved if you did not
understand them.&nbsp; Should you hereafter condemn me, I shall not
love you less.&nbsp; I will say no more.&nbsp; Judge for yourself about
going or staying.&nbsp; I wish you to consider yourself, if you could
be wise enough to do that, for the first time in your life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Thine,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;A.
I. B.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Addressed on the cover, &lsquo;To The Hon. Mrs. Leigh.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter not being dated, we have no clue but what we obtain from
its own internal evidence.&nbsp; It certainly is not written in Lady
Byron&rsquo;s usual clear and elegant style; and is, in this respect,
in striking contrast to all her letters that I have ever seen.</p>
<p>But the notes written by a young woman under such peculiar and distressing
circumstances must not be judged by the standard of calmer hours.</p>
<p>Subsequently to this letter, and during that stormy, irrational period
when Lord Byron&rsquo;s conduct became daily more and more unaccountable,
may have come that startling scene in which Lord Byron took every pains
to convince his wife of improper relations subsisting between himself
and his sister.</p>
<p>What an <i>utter</i> desolation this must have been to the wife,
tearing from her the last hold of friendship, and the last refuge to
which she had clung in her sorrows, may easily be conceived.</p>
<p>In this crisis, it appears that the <i>sister</i> convinced Lady
Byron that the whole was to be attributed to insanity.&nbsp; It would
be a conviction gladly accepted, and bringing infinite relief, although
still surrounding her path with fearful difficulties.</p>
<p>That such was the case is plainly asserted by Lady Byron in her statement
published in 1830.&nbsp; Speaking of her separation, Lady Byron says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The facts are, I left London for Kirkby Mallory,
the residence of my father and mother, on the 15th of January, 1816.&nbsp;
Lord Byron had signified to me in writing, Jan. 6, his absolute desire
that I should leave London on the earliest day that I could conveniently
fix.&nbsp; It was not safe for me to encounter the fatigues of a journey
sooner than the 15th.&nbsp; Previously to my departure, it had been
strongly impressed on my mind that Lord Byron was under the influence
of insanity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This opinion was in a great measure derived from the communications
made to me by his nearest relatives and personal attendant&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now there was no nearer relative than Mrs. Leigh; and the personal
attendant was Fletcher.&nbsp; It was therefore presumably Mrs. Leigh
who convinced Lady Byron of her husband&rsquo;s insanity.</p>
<p>Lady Byron says, &lsquo;It was even represented to me that he was
in danger of destroying himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<i>With the concurrence</i> of his family, I had consulted
with Dr. Baillie, as a friend, on Jan. 8, as to his supposed malady.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Now, Lord Byron&rsquo;s written order for her to leave came on Jan.
6.&nbsp; It appears, then, that Lady Byron, acting in concurrence with
Mrs. Leigh and others of her husband&rsquo;s family, consulted Dr. Baillie,
on Jan. 8, as to what she should do; the symptoms presented to Dr. Baillie
being, evidently, insane hatred of his wife on the part of Lord Byron,
and a determination to get her out of the house.&nbsp; Lady Byron goes
on:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;On acquainting him with the state of the case,
and with Lord Byron&rsquo;s desire that I should leave London, Dr. Baillie
thought my absence might be advisable as an experiment, assuming the
fact of mental derangement; for Dr. Baillie, not having had access to
Lord Byron, could not pronounce an opinion on that point.&nbsp; He enjoined,
that, in correspondence with Lord Byron, I should avoid all but light
and soothing topics.&nbsp; Under these impressions, I left London, determined
to follow the advice given me by Dr. Baillie.&nbsp; Whatever might have
been the nature of Lord Byron&rsquo;s treatment of me from the time
of my marriage, yet, supposing him to have been in a state of mental
alienation, it was not for me, nor for any person of common humanity,
to manifest at that moment a sense of injury.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears, then, that the domestic situation in Byron&rsquo;s house
at the time of his wife&rsquo;s expulsion was one so grave as to call
for family counsel; for Lady Byron, generally accurate, speaks in the
plural number.&nbsp; &lsquo;His <i>nearest</i> relatives&rsquo; certainly
includes Mrs. Leigh.&nbsp; &lsquo;His family&rsquo; includes more.&nbsp;
That some of Lord Byron&rsquo;s own relatives were cognisant of facts
at this time, and that they took Lady Byron&rsquo;s side, is shown by
one of his own chance admissions.&nbsp; In vol. vi. p.394, in a letter
on Bowles, he says, speaking of this time, <i>&lsquo;All my relations</i>,
save one, fell from me like leaves from a tree in autumn.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And in Medwin&rsquo;s Conversations he says, &lsquo;Even my cousin George
Byron, who had been brought up with me, and whom I loved as a brother,
took my wife&rsquo;s part.&rsquo;&nbsp; The conduct must have been marked
in the extreme that led to this result.</p>
<p>We cannot help stopping here to say that Lady Byron&rsquo;s situation
at this time has been discussed in our days with a want of ordinary
human feeling that is surprising.&nbsp; Let any father and mother, reading
this, look on their own daughter, and try to make the case their own.</p>
<p>After a few short months of married life,&mdash;months full of patient
endurance of the strangest and most unaccountable treatment,&mdash;she
comes to them, expelled from her husband&rsquo;s house, an object of
hatred and aversion to him, and having to settle for herself the awful
question, whether he is a dangerous madman or a determined villain.</p>
<p>Such was this young wife&rsquo;s situation.</p>
<p>With a heart at times wrung with compassion for her husband as a
helpless maniac, and fearful that all may end in suicide, yet compelled
to leave him, she writes on the road the much-quoted letter, beginning
&lsquo;Dear Duck.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is an exaggerated and unnatural
letter, it is true, but of precisely the character that might be expected
from an inexperienced young wife when dealing with a husband supposed
to be insane.</p>
<p>The next day, she addressed to Augusta this letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;MY DEAREST A.,&mdash;It is my great comfort that
you are still in Piccadilly.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again, on the 23rd:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;DEAREST A.,&mdash;I know you feel for me, as I
do for you; and perhaps I am better understood than I think.&nbsp; You
have been, ever since I knew you, my best comforter; and will so remain,
unless you grow tired of the office,&mdash;which may well be.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can see here how self-denying and heroic appears to Lady Byron
the conduct of the sister, who patiently remains to soothe and guide
and restrain the moody madman, whose madness takes a form, at times,
so repulsive to every womanly feeling.&nbsp; She intimates that she
should not wonder should Augusta grow weary of the office.</p>
<p>Lady Byron continues her statement thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;When I arrived at Kirkby Mallory, my parents were
unacquainted with the existence of any causes likely to destroy my prospects
of happiness; and, when I communicated to them the opinion that had
been formed concerning Lord Byron&rsquo;s state of mind, they were most
anxious to promote his restoration by every means in their power.&nbsp;
They assured those relations that were with him in London that &ldquo;they
would devote their whole case and attention to the alleviation of his
malady.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we have a <i>quotation</i> <a name="citation190a"></a><a href="#footnote190a">{190a}</a>
from a letter written by Lady Milbanke to the anxious &lsquo;relations&rsquo;
who are taking counsel about Lord Byron in town.&nbsp; Lady Byron also
adds, in justification of her mother from Lord Byron&rsquo;s slanders,
&lsquo;She had always treated him with an affectionate consideration
and indulgence, which extended to every little peculiarity of his feelings.&nbsp;
Never did an irritating word escape her lips in her whole intercourse
with him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now comes a remarkable part of Lady Byron&rsquo;s statement:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The accounts given me after I left Lord Byron,
by those in constant intercourse with him, <a name="citation190b"></a><a href="#footnote190b">{190b}</a>
added to those doubts which had before transiently occurred to my mind
as to the reality of the alleged disease; and the reports of his medical
attendants were far from establishing anything like lunacy.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When these doubts arose in her mind, it is not natural to suppose
that they should, at first, involve Mrs. Leigh.&nbsp; She still appears
to Lady Byron as the devoted, believing sister, fully convinced of her
brother&rsquo;s insanity, and endeavouring to restrain and control him.</p>
<p>But if Lord Byron were sane, if the purposes he had avowed to his
wife were real, he must have lied about his sister in the past, and
perhaps have the worst intentions for the future.</p>
<p>The horrors of that state of vacillation between the conviction of
insanity and the commencing conviction of something worse can scarcely
be told.</p>
<p>At all events, the wife&rsquo;s doubts extend so far that she speaks
out to her parents.&nbsp; &lsquo;UNDER THIS UNCERTAINTY,&rsquo; says
the statement, &lsquo;I deemed it right to communicate to my parents,
that, if I were to consider Lord Byron&rsquo;s past conduct as that
of a person of sound mind, <i>nothing could induce me to return to him</i>.&nbsp;
It therefore appeared expedient, both to them and to myself, to consult
the ablest advisers.&nbsp; For that object, and also to obtain still
further information respecting appearances which indicated mental derangement,
my mother determined to go to London.&nbsp; She was empowered by me
to take legal opinion on a written statement of mine; though I then
had reasons for reserving a <i>part of the case from the knowledge even
of my father and mother</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is during this time of uncertainty that the next letter to Mrs.
Leigh may be placed.&nbsp; It seems to be rather a fragment of a letter
than a whole one: perhaps it is an extract; in which case it would be
desirable, if possible, to view it in connection with the remaining
text:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jan.
25, 1816.</p>
<p>&lsquo;MY DEAREST AUGUSTA,&mdash;Shall I still be your sister?&nbsp;
I must resign my right to be so considered; but I don&rsquo;t think
that will make any difference in the kindness I have so uniformly experienced
from you.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This fragment is not signed, nor finished in any way, but indicates
that the writer is about to take a decisive step.</p>
<p>On the 17th, as we have seen, Lady Milbanke had written, inviting
Lord Byron.&nbsp; Subsequently she went to London to make more particular
inquiries into his state.&nbsp; This fragment seems part of a letter
from Lady Byron, called forth in view of some evidence resulting from
her mother&rsquo;s observations. <a name="citation192"></a><a href="#footnote192">{192}</a></p>
<p>Lady Byron now adds,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Being convinced by the result of these inquiries,
and by the tenour of Lord Byron&rsquo;s proceedings, that the notion
of insanity was an illusion, I no longer hesitated to authorize such
measures as were necessary in order to secure me from ever being again
placed in his power.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Conformably with this resolution, my father wrote to him,
on the 2nd of February, to request an amicable separation.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following letter to Mrs. Leigh is dated the day after this application,
and is in many respects a noticeable one:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;KIRKBY
MALLORY, Feb. 3, 1816.</p>
<p>&lsquo;MY DEAREST AUGUSTA,&mdash;You are desired by your brother
to ask if my father has acted with my concurrence in proposing a separation.&nbsp;
He has.&nbsp; It cannot be supposed, that, in my present distressing
situation, I am capable of stating in a detailed manner the reasons
which will not only justify this measure, but compel me to take it;
and it never can be my wish to remember unnecessarily [sic] those injuries
for which, however deep, I feel no resentment.&nbsp; I will now only
recall to Lord Byron&rsquo;s mind his avowed and insurmountable aversion
to the married state, and the desire and determination he has expressed
ever since its commencement to free himself from that bondage, as finding
it quite insupportable, though candidly acknowledging that no effort
of duty or affection has been wanting on my part.&nbsp; He has too painfully
convinced me that all these attempts to contribute towards his happiness
were wholly useless, and most unwelcome to him.&nbsp; I enclose this
letter to my father, wishing it to receive his sanction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Ever
yours most affectionately,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;A.
I. BYRON.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We observe in this letter that it is written to <i>be shown</i> to
Lady Byron&rsquo;s father, and receive his sanction; and, as that father
was in ignorance of all the deeper causes of trouble in the case, it
will be seen that the letter must necessarily be a reserved one.&nbsp;
This sufficiently accounts for the guarded character of the language
when speaking of the causes of separation.&nbsp; One part of the letter
incidentally overthrows Lord Byron&rsquo;s statement, which he always
repeated during his life, and which is repeated for him now; namely,
that his wife <i>forsook</i> him, instead of being, as she claims, <i>expelled</i>
by him.</p>
<p>She recalls to Lord Byron&rsquo;s mind the &lsquo;desire and <i>determination</i>
he has expressed ever since his marriage to free himself from its bondage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is in perfect keeping with the <i>&lsquo;absolute</i> desire,&rsquo;
signified by writing, that she should leave his house on the earliest
day possible; and she places the cause of the separation on his having
&lsquo;too painfully&rsquo; convinced her that he does not want her&mdash;as
a wife.</p>
<p>It appears that Augusta hesitates to show this note to her brother.&nbsp;
It is bringing on a crisis which she, above all others, would most wish
to avoid.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Lady Byron receives a letter from Lord Byron, which
makes her feel it more than ever essential to make the decision final.&nbsp;
I have reason to believe that this letter is preserved in Lady Byron&rsquo;s
papers:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Feb.
4, 1816.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope, my dear A., that you would on no account withhold
from your brother the letter which I sent yesterday in answer to yours
written by his desire, particularly as one which I have received from
himself to-day renders it still more important that he should know the
contents of that addressed to you.&nbsp; I am, in haste and not very
well,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Yours
most affectionately,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;A.
I. BYRON.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The last of this series of letters is less like the style of Lady
Byron than any of them.&nbsp; We cannot judge whether it is a whole
consecutive letter, or fragments from a letter, selected and united.&nbsp;
There is a great want of that clearness and precision which usually
characterised Lady Byron&rsquo;s style.&nbsp; It shows, however, that
the decision is made,&mdash;a decision which she regrets on account
of the sister who has tried so long to prevent it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;KIRKBY
MALLORY, Feb. 14, 1816.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The present sufferings of all may yet be repaid in blessings.&nbsp;
Do not despair absolutely, dearest; and leave me but enough of your
interest to afford you any consolation by partaking of that sorrow which
I am most unhappy to cause thus unintentionally.&nbsp; You will be of
my opinion hereafter; and at present your bitterest reproach would be
forgiven, though Heaven knows you have considered me more than a thousand
would have done,&mdash;more than anything but my affection for B., one
most dear to you, could deserve.&nbsp; I must not remember these feelings.&nbsp;
Farewell!&nbsp; God bless you from the bottom of my heart!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;A.
I. B.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are here to consider that Mrs. Leigh has stood to Lady Byron in
all this long agony as her only confidante and friend; that she has
denied the charges her brother has made, and referred them to insanity,
admitting insane <i>attempts</i> upon herself which she has been obliged
to watch over and control.</p>
<p>Lady Byron has come to the conclusion that Augusta is mistaken as
to insanity; that there is a real wicked purpose and desire on the part
of the brother, not as yet believed in by the sister.&nbsp; She regards
the sister as one, who, though deceived and blinded, is still worthy
of confidence and consideration; and so says to her, <i>&lsquo;You will
be of my opinion hereafter</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She says, &lsquo;You have considered me more than a thousand would
have done.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Leigh is, in Lady Byron&rsquo;s eyes, a
most abused and innocent woman, who, to spare her sister in her delicate
situation, has taken on herself the whole charge of a maniacal brother,
although suffering from him language and actions of the most injurious
kind.&nbsp; That Mrs. Leigh did not flee the house at once under such
circumstances, and wholly decline the management of the case, seems
to Lady Byron consideration and self-sacrifice greater than she can
acknowledge.</p>
<p>The knowledge of the <i>whole extent of the truth</i> came to Lady
Byron&rsquo;s mind at a later period.</p>
<p>We now take up the history from Lushington&rsquo;s letter to Lady
Byron, published at the close of her statement.</p>
<p>The application to Lord Byron for an act of separation was positively
refused at first; it being an important part of his policy that all
the responsibility and insistence should come from his wife, and that
he should appear forced into it contrary to his will.</p>
<p>Dr. Lushington, however, says to Lady Byron,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I was originally consulted by Lady Noel on your
behalf while you were in the country.&nbsp; The circumstances detailed
by her were such as justified a separation; but they were not of that
aggravated description as to render such a measure indispensable.&nbsp;
On Lady Noel&rsquo;s representations, I deemed a reconciliation with
Lord Byron practicable, and felt most sincerely a wish to aid in effecting
it.&nbsp; There was not, on Lady Noel&rsquo;s part, any exaggeration
of the facts, nor, so far as I could perceive, any determination to
prevent a return to Lord Byron: certainly none was expressed when I
spoke of a reconciliation.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this crisis, with Lord Byron refusing the separation, with Lushington
expressing a wish to aid in a reconciliation, and Lady Noel not expressing
any aversion to it, the whole strain of the dreadful responsibility
comes upon the wife.</p>
<p>She resolves to ask counsel of her lawyer, in view of a statement
of the <i>whole</i> case.</p>
<p>Lady Byron is spoken of by Lord Byron (letter 233) as being in town
with her father on the 29th of February; viz., fifteen days after the
date of the last letter to Mrs. Leigh.&nbsp; It must have been about
this time, then, that she laid her whole case before Lushington; and
he gave it a thorough examination.</p>
<p>The result was, that Lushington expressed in the most decided terms
his conviction that reconciliation was impossible.&nbsp; The language
be uses is very striking:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;When you came to town in about a fortnight, or
perhaps more, after my first interview with Lady Noel, I was, for the
first time, informed by you of facts utterly unknown, as I have no doubt,
to Sir Ralph and Lady Noel.&nbsp; On receiving this additional information,
my opinion was entirely changed.&nbsp; I considered a reconciliation
impossible.&nbsp; I declared my opinion, and added, that, if such an
idea should be entertained, I could not, either professionally or otherwise,
take any part towards effecting it.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does not appear in this note what effect the lawyer&rsquo;s examination
of the case had on Lady Byron&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; By the expressions
he uses, we should infer that she may still have been hesitating as
to whether a reconciliation might not be her duty.</p>
<p>This hesitancy he does away with most decisively, saying, &lsquo;A
reconciliation is impossible;&rsquo; and, supposing Lady Byron or her
friends desirous of one, he declares positively that he cannot, either
professionally as a lawyer or privately as a friend, have anything to
do with effecting it.</p>
<p>The lawyer, it appears, has drawn, from the facts of the case, inferences
deeper and stronger than those which presented themselves to the mind
of the young woman; and he instructs her in the most absolute terms.</p>
<p>Fourteen years after, in 1830, for the first time the world was astonished
by this declaration from Dr. Lushington, in language so pronounced and
positive that there could be no mistake.</p>
<p>Lady Byron had stood all these fourteen years slandered by her husband,
and misunderstood by his friends, when, had she so chosen, this opinion
of Dr. Lushington&rsquo;s could have been at once made public, which
fully justified her conduct.</p>
<p>If, as the &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; of July insinuates, the story
told to Lushington was a malignant slander, meant to injure Lord Byron,
why did she suppress the judgment of her counsel at a time when all
the world was on her side, and this decision would have been the decisive
blow against her husband?&nbsp; Why, by sealing the lips of counsel,
and of all whom she could influence, did she deprive herself finally
of the very advantage for which it has been assumed she fabricated the
story?</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV.&nbsp; THE CHARACTER OF THE TWO WITNESSES COMPARED.</h3>
<p>It will be observed, that, in this controversy, we are confronting
two opposing stories,&mdash;one of Lord and the other of Lady Byron;
and the statements from each are in point-blank contradiction.</p>
<p>Lord Byron states that his wife deserted him.&nbsp; Lady Byron states
that he expelled her, and reminds him, in her letter to Augusta Leigh,
that the expulsion was a deliberate one, and that he had purposed it
from the beginning of their marriage.</p>
<p>Lord Byron always stated that he was ignorant why his wife left him,
and was desirous of her return.&nbsp; Lady Byron states that he told
her that he would force her to leave him, and to leave him in such a
way that the whole blame of the separation should always rest on her,
and not on him.</p>
<p>To say nothing of any deeper or darker accusations on either side,
here, in the very outworks of the story, the two meet point-blank.</p>
<p>In considering two opposing stories, we always, as a matter of fact,
take into account the character of the witnesses.</p>
<p>If a person be literal and exact in his usual modes of speech, reserved,
careful, conscientious, and in the habit of observing minutely the minor
details of time, place, and circumstances, we give weight to his testimony
from these considerations.&nbsp; But if a person be proved to have singular
and exceptional principles with regard to truth; if he be universally
held by society to be so in the habit of mystification, that large allowances
must be made for his statements; if his assertions at one time contradict
those made at another; and if his statements, also, sometimes come in
collision with those of his best friends, so that, when his language
is reported, difficulties follow, and explanations are made necessary,&mdash;all
this certainly disqualifies him from being considered a trustworthy
witness.</p>
<p>All these disqualifications belong in a remarkable degree to Lord
Byron, on the oft-repeated testimony of his best friends.</p>
<p>We shall first cite the following testimony, given in an article
from &lsquo;Under the Crown,&rsquo; which is written by an early friend
and ardent admirer of Lord Byron:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Byron had one pre-eminent fault,&mdash;a fault
which must be considered as deeply criminal by everyone who does not,
as I do, believe it to have resulted from monomania.&nbsp; He had a
morbid love of a bad reputation.&nbsp; There was hardly an offence of
which he would not, with perfect indifference, accuse himself.&nbsp;
An old schoolfellow who met him on the Continent told me that he would
continually write paragraphs against himself in the foreign journals,
and delight in their republication by the English newspapers as in the
success of a practical joke.&nbsp; Whenever anybody has related anything
discreditable of Byron, assuring me that it must be true, for he heard
it from himself, I always felt that he could not have spoken upon worse
authority; and that, in all probability, the tale was a pure invention.&nbsp;
If I could remember, and were willing to repeat, the various misdoings
which I have from time to time heard him attribute to himself, I could
fill a volume.&nbsp; But I never believed them.&nbsp; I very soon became
aware of this strange idiosyncrasy: it puzzled me to account for it;
but there it was, a sort of diseased and distorted vanity.&nbsp; The
same eccentric spirit would induce him to report things which were false
with regard to his family, which anybody else would have concealed,
though true.&nbsp; He told me more than once that his father was insane,
and killed himself.&nbsp; I shall never forget the manner in which he
first told me this.&nbsp; While washing his hands, and singing a gay
Neapolitan air, he stopped, looked round at me, and said, &ldquo;There
always was madness in the family.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, after continuing
his washing and his song, he added, as if speaking of a matter of the
slightest indifference, &ldquo;My father cut his throat.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The contrast between the tenour of the subject and the levity of the
expression was fearfully painful: it was like a stanza of &ldquo;Don
Juan.&rdquo;&nbsp; In this instance, I had no doubt that the fact was
as he related it; but in speaking of it, only a few years since, to
an old lady in whom I had perfect confidence, she assured me that it
was not so.&nbsp; Mr. Byron, who was her cousin, had been extremely
wild, but was quite sane, and had died very quietly in his bed.&nbsp;
What Byron&rsquo;s reason could have been for thus calumniating not
only himself but the blood which was flowing in his veins, who can divine?&nbsp;
But, for some reason or other, it seemed to be his determined purpose
to keep himself unknown to the great body of his fellow-creatures; to
present himself to their view in moral masquerade.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly the character of Lord Byron here given by his friend is
not the kind to make him a trustworthy witness in any case: on the contrary,
it seems to show either a subtle delight in falsehood for falsehood&rsquo;s
sake, or else the wary artifices of a man who, having a deadly secret
to conceal, employs many turnings and windings to throw the world off
the scent.&nbsp; What intriguer, having a crime to cover, could devise
a more artful course than to send half a dozen absurd stories to the
press, which should, after a while, be traced back to himself, till
the public should gradually look on all it heard from him as the result
of this eccentric humour?</p>
<p>The easy, trifling air with which Lord Byron made to this friend
a false statement in regard to his father would lead naturally to the
inquiry, on what <i>other</i> subjects, equally important to the good
name of others, he might give false testimony with equal indifference.</p>
<p>When Medwin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Conversations with Lord Byron&rsquo; were
first published, they contained a number of declarations of the noble
lord affecting the honour and honesty of his friend and publisher Murray.&nbsp;
These appear to have been made in the same way as those about his father,
and with equal indifference.&nbsp; So serious were the charges, that
Mr. Murray&rsquo;s friends felt that he ought, in justice to himself,
to come forward and confront them with the facts as stated in Byron&rsquo;s
letters to himself; and in vol. x., p.143, of Murray&rsquo;s standard
edition, accordingly these false statements are confronted with the
letters of Lord Byron.&nbsp; The statements, as reported, are of a most
material and vital nature, relating to Murray&rsquo;s financial honour
and honesty, and to his general truthfulness and sincerity.&nbsp; In
reply, Murray opposes to them the accounts of sums paid for different
works, and letters from Byron exactly contradicting his own statements
as to Murray&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p>The subject, as we have seen, was discussed in &lsquo;The Noctes.&rsquo;&nbsp;
No doubt appears to be entertained that Byron made the statements to
Medwin; and the theory of accounting for them is, that &lsquo;Byron
was &ldquo;bamming&rdquo; him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It seems never to have occurred to any of these credulous gentlemen,
who laughed at others for being &lsquo;bammed,&rsquo; that Byron might
be doing the very same thing by themselves.&nbsp; How many of his so-called
packages sent to Lady Byron were <i>real</i> packages, and how many
were mystifications?&nbsp; We find, in two places at least in his Memoir,
letters to Lady Byron, written and shown to others, which, he says,
were never sent by him.&nbsp; He told Lady Blessington that he was in
the habit of writing to her <i>constantly</i>.&nbsp; Was this &lsquo;bamming&rsquo;?&nbsp;
Was he &lsquo;bamming,&rsquo; also, when he told the world that Lady
Byron suddenly deserted him, quite to his surprise, and that he never,
to his dying day, could find out why?</p>
<p>Lady Blessington relates, that, in one of his conversations with
her, he entertained her by repeating epigrams and lampoons, in which
many of his friends were treated with severity.&nbsp; She inquired of
him, in case he should die, and such proofs of his friendship come before
the public, what would be the feelings of these friends, who had supposed
themselves to stand so high in his good graces.&nbsp; She says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Byron, &ldquo;is precisely
one of the ideas that most amuses me.&nbsp; I often fancy the rage and
humiliation of my quondam friends in hearing the truth, at least from
me, for the first time, and when I am beyond the reach of their malice.
. . .&nbsp; What grief,&rdquo; continued Byron, laughing, &ldquo;could
resist the charges of ugliness, dulness, or any of the thousand nameless
defects, personal or mental, &lsquo;that flesh is heir to,&rsquo; when
reprisal or recantation was impossible? . . .&nbsp; People are in such
daily habits of commenting on the defects of friends, that they are
unconscious of the unkindness of it. . . Now, I write down as well as
speak my sentiments of those who think they have gulled me; and I only
wish, in case I die before them, that I might return to witness the
effects my posthumous opinions of them are likely to produce in their
minds.&nbsp; What good fun this would be! . . .&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t
seem to value this as you ought,&rdquo; said Byron with one of his sardonic
smiles, seeing I looked, as I really felt, surprised at his avowed insincerity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I feel the same pleasure in anticipating the rage and mortification
of my soi-disant friends at the discovery of my real sentiments of them,
that a miser may be supposed to feel while making a will that will disappoint
all the expectants that have been toadying him for years.&nbsp; Then
how amusing it will be to compare my posthumous with my previously given
opinions, the one throwing ridicule on the other!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is asserted, in a note to &lsquo;The Noctes,&rsquo; that Byron,
besides his Autobiography, prepared a voluminous dictionary of all his
friends and acquaintances, in which brief notes of their persons and
character were given, with his opinion of them.&nbsp; It was not considered
that the publication of this would add to the noble lord&rsquo;s popularity;
and it has never appeared.</p>
<p>In Hunt&rsquo;s Life of Byron, there is similar testimony.&nbsp;
Speaking of Byron&rsquo;s carelessness in exposing his friends&rsquo;
secrets, and showing or giving away their letters, he says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;If his five hundred confidants, by a reticence
as remarkable as his laxity, had not kept his secrets better than he
did himself, the very devil might have been played with I don&rsquo;t
know how many people.&nbsp; But there was always this saving reflection
to be made, that the man who could be guilty of such extravagances for
the sake of making an impression might be guilty of exaggeration, or
inventing what astonished you; and indeed, though he was a speaker of
the truth on ordinary occasions,&mdash;that is to say, he did not tell
you he had seen a dozen horses when he had seen only two,&mdash;yet,
as he professed not to value the truth when in the way of his advantage
(and there was nothing he thought more to his advantage than making
you stare at him), the persons who were liable to suffer from his incontinence
had all the right in the world to the benefit of this consideration.&rsquo;
<a name="citation205a"></a><a href="#footnote205a">{205a}</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With a person of such mental and moral habits as to truth, the inquiry
always must be, <i>Where</i> does mystification end, and truth begin?</p>
<p>If a man is careless about his father&rsquo;s reputation for sanity,
and reports him a crazy suicide; if he gaily accuses his publisher and
good friend of double-dealing, shuffling, and dishonesty; if he tells
stories about Mrs. Clermont, <a name="citation205b"></a><a href="#footnote205b">{205b}</a>
to which his sister offers a public refutation,&mdash;is it to be supposed
that he will always tell the truth about his wife, when the world is
pressing him hard, and every instinct of self-defence is on the alert?</p>
<p>And then the ingenuity that could write and publish false documents
about himself, that they might reappear in London papers,&mdash;to what
other accounts might it not be turned?&nbsp; Might it not create documents,
invent statements, about his wife as well as himself?</p>
<p>The document so ostentatiously given to M. G. Lewis &lsquo;for circulation
among friends in England&rsquo; was a specimen of what the Noctes Club
would call &lsquo;bamming.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If Byron wanted a legal investigation, why did he not take it in
the first place, instead of signing the separation?&nbsp; If he wanted
to cancel it, as he said in this document, why did he not go to London,
and enter a suit for the restitution of conjugal rights, or a suit in
chancery to get possession of his daughter?&nbsp; That this was in his
mind, passages in Medwin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Conversations&rsquo; show.&nbsp;
He told Lady Blessington also that he might claim his daughter in chancery
at any time.</p>
<p>Why did he not do it?&nbsp; Either of these two steps would have
brought on that public investigation he so longed for.&nbsp; Can it
be possible that all the friends who passed this private document from
hand to hand never suspected that they were being &lsquo;bammed&rsquo;
by it?</p>
<p>But it has been universally assumed, that, though Byron was thus
remarkably given to mystification, yet <i>all</i> his statements in
regard to this story are to be accepted, simply because he makes them.&nbsp;
<i>Why</i> must we accept them, any more than his statements as to Murray
or his own father?</p>
<p>So we constantly find Lord Byron&rsquo;s incidental statements coming
in collision with those of others: for example, in his account of his
marriage, he tells Medwin that Lady Byron&rsquo;s maid was put between
his bride and himself, on the same seat, in the wedding journey.&nbsp;
The lady&rsquo;s maid herself, Mrs. Mimms, says she was sent before
them to Halnaby, and was there to receive them when they alighted.</p>
<p>He said of Lady Byron&rsquo;s mother, &lsquo;She always detested
me, and had not the decency to conceal it in her own house.&nbsp; Dining
with her one day, I broke a tooth, and was in great pain; which I could
not help showing.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will do you good,&rdquo; said Lady
Noel; &ldquo;I am glad of it!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Byron says, speaking of her mother, &lsquo;She always treated
him with an affectionate consideration and indulgence, which extended
to every little peculiarity of his feelings.&nbsp; Never did an irritating
word escape her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lord Byron states that the correspondence between him and Lady Byron,
after his refusal, was first opened by her.&nbsp; Lady Byron&rsquo;s
friends deny the statement, and assert that the direct contrary is the
fact.</p>
<p>Thus we see that Lord Byron&rsquo;s statements are directly opposed
to those of his family in relation to his father; directly against Murray&rsquo;s
accounts, and his own admission to Murray; directly against the statement
of the lady&rsquo;s maid as to her position in the journey; directly
against Mrs. Leigh&rsquo;s as to Mrs. Clermont, and against Lady Byron
as to her mother.</p>
<p>We can see, also, that these misstatements were so fully perceived
by the men of his times, that Medwin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Conversations&rsquo;
were simply laughed at as an amusing instance of how far a man might
be made the victim of a mystification.&nbsp; Christopher North thus
sentences the book:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to call Medwin a liar . . .&nbsp;
The captain lies, sir, but it is under a thousand mistakes.&nbsp; Whether
Byron bammed him, or he, by virtue of his own egregious stupidity, was
the sole and sufficient bammifier of himself, I know not; neither greatly
do I care.&nbsp; This much is certain, . . . that the book throughout
is full of things that were not, and most resplendently deficient quoad
the things that were.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet it is on Medwin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Conversations&rsquo; alone that
many of the magazine assertions in regard to Lady Byron are founded.</p>
<p>It is on that authority that Lady Byron is accused of breaking open
her husband&rsquo;s writing-desk in his absence, and sending the letters
she found there to the husband of a lady compromised by them; and likewise
that Lord Byron is declared to have paid back his wife&rsquo;s ten-thousand-pound
wedding portion, and doubled it.&nbsp; Moore makes no such statements;
and his remarks about Lord Byron&rsquo;s use of his wife&rsquo;s money
are unmistakable evidence to the contrary.&nbsp; Moore, although Byron&rsquo;s
ardent partisan, was too well informed to make assertions with regard
to him, which, at that time, it would have been perfectly easy to refute.</p>
<p>All these facts go to show that Lord Byron&rsquo;s character for
accuracy or veracity was not such as to entitle him to ordinary confidence
as a witness, especially in a case where he had the strongest motives
for misstatement.</p>
<p>And if we consider that the celebrated Autobiography was the finished,
careful work of such a practised &lsquo;mystifier,&rsquo; who can wonder
that it presented a web of such intermingled truth and lies that there
was no such thing as disentangling it, and pointing out where falsehood
ended and truth began?</p>
<p>But in regard to Lady Byron, what has been the universal impression
of the world?&nbsp; It has been alleged against her that she was a precise,
straightforward woman, so accustomed to plain, literal dealings, that
she could not understand the various mystifications of her husband;
and from that cause arose her unhappiness.&nbsp; Byron speaks, in &lsquo;The
Sketch,&rsquo; of her <i>peculiar</i> truthfulness; and even in the
&lsquo;Clytemnestra&rsquo; poem, when accusing her of lying, he speaks
of her as departing from</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The early truth that was her proper praise.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lady Byron&rsquo;s careful accuracy as to dates, to time, place,
and circumstances, will probably be vouched for by all the very large
number of persons whom the management of her extended property and her
works of benevolence brought to act as co-operators or agents with her.&nbsp;
She was not a person in the habit of making exaggerated or ill-considered
statements.&nbsp; Her published statement of 1830 is clear, exact, accurate,
and perfectly intelligible.&nbsp; The dates are carefully ascertained
and stated, the expressions are moderate, and all the assertions firm
and perfectly definite.</p>
<p>It therefore seems remarkable that the whole reasoning on this Byron
matter has generally been conducted by assuming all Lord Byron&rsquo;s
statements to be true, and requiring all Lady Byron&rsquo;s statements
to be sustained by other evidence.</p>
<p>If Lord Byron asserts that his wife deserted him, the assertion is
accepted without proof; but, if Lady Byron asserts that he ordered her
to leave, that requires proof.&nbsp; Lady Byron asserts that she took
counsel, on this order of Lord Byron, with his family friends and physician,
under the idea that it originated in insanity.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo;
asks, &ldquo;<i>What</i> family friends?&rsquo; says it doesn&rsquo;t
know of any; and asks proof.</p>
<p>If Lord Byron asserts that he always longed for a public investigation
of the charges against him, the &lsquo;Quarterly&rsquo; and &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo;
quote the saying with ingenuous confidence.&nbsp; They are obliged to
admit that he refused to stand that public test; that he signed the
deed of separation rather than meet it.&nbsp; They know, also, that
he could have at any time instituted suits against Lady Byron that would
have brought the whole matter into court, and that he did not.&nbsp;
Why did he not?&nbsp; The &lsquo;Quarterly&rsquo; simply intimates that
such suits would have been unpleasant.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; On account of
personal delicacy?&nbsp; The man that wrote &lsquo;Don Juan,&rsquo;
and furnished the details of his wedding-night, held back from clearing
his name by delicacy!&nbsp; It is astonishing to what extent this controversy
has consisted in simply repeating Lord Byron&rsquo;s assertions over
and over again, and calling the result proof.</p>
<p>Now, we propose a different course.&nbsp; As Lady Byron is not stated
by her warm admirers to have had <i>any</i> monomania for speaking untruths
on any subject, we rank her value as a witness at a higher rate than
Lord Byron&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She never accused her parents of madness or
suicide, merely to make a sensation; never &lsquo;bammed&rsquo; an acquaintance
by false statements concerning the commercial honour of anyone with
whom she was in business relations; never wrote and sent to the press
as a clever jest false statements about herself; and never, in any other
ingenious way, tampered with truth.&nbsp; We therefore hold it to be
a mere dictate of reason and common sense, that, in all cases where
her statements conflict with her husband&rsquo;s, hers are to be taken
as the more trustworthy.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;London Quarterly,&rsquo; in a late article, distinctly
repudiates Lady Byron&rsquo;s statements as sources of evidence, and
throughout quotes statements of Lord Byron as if they had the force
of self-evident propositions.&nbsp; We consider such a course contrary
to common sense as well as common good manners.</p>
<p>The state of the case is just this: If Lord Byron did not make false
statements on this subject it was certainly an exception to his usual
course.&nbsp; He certainly did make such on a great variety of other
subjects.&nbsp; By his own showing, he had a peculiar pleasure in falsifying
language, and in misleading and betraying even his friends.</p>
<p>But, if Lady Byron gave false witness upon this subject, it was an
exception to the whole course of her life.</p>
<p>The habits of her mind, the government of her conduct, her life-long
reputation, all were those of a literal, exact truthfulness.</p>
<p>The accusation of her being untruthful was first brought forward
by her husband in the &lsquo;Clytemnestra&rsquo; poem, in the autumn
of 1816; but it never was publicly circulated till after his death,
and it was first formally made the basis of a published attack on Lady
Byron in the July &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; of 1869.&nbsp; Up to that
time, we look in vain through current literature for any indications
that the world regarded Lady Byron otherwise than as a cold, careful,
prudent woman, who made no assertions, and had no confidants.&nbsp;
When she spoke in 1830, it is perfectly evident that Christopher North
and his circle believed what she said, though reproving her for saying
it at all.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Quarterly&rsquo; goes on to heap up a number of vague
assertions,&mdash;that Lady Byron, about the time of her separation,
made a confidant of a young officer; that she told the clergyman of
Ham of some trials with Lord Ockham; and that she told stories of different
things at different times.</p>
<p>All this is not proof: it is mere assertion, and assertion made to
produce prejudice.&nbsp; It is like raising a whirlwind of sand to blind
the eyes that are looking for landmarks.&nbsp; It is quite probable
Lady Byron told different stories about Lord Byron at various times.&nbsp;
No woman could have a greater variety of stories to tell; and no woman
ever was so persecuted and pursued and harassed, both by public literature
and private friendship, to say <i>something</i>.&nbsp; She had plenty
of causes for a separation, without the fatal and final one.&nbsp; In
her conversations with Lady Anne Barnard, for example, she gives reasons
enough for a separation, though none of them are the chief one.&nbsp;
It is not <i>different</i> stories, but <i>contradictory</i> stories,
that must be relied on to disprove the credibility of a witness.&nbsp;
The &lsquo;Quarterly&rsquo; has certainly told a great number of different
stories,&mdash;stories which may prove as irreconcilable with each other
as any attributed to Lady Byron; but its denial of all weight to her
testimony is simply begging the whole question under consideration.</p>
<p>A man gives testimony about the causes of a railroad accident, being
the only eye-witness.</p>
<p>The opposing counsel begs, whatever else you do, you will not admit
that man&rsquo;s testimony.&nbsp; You ask, &lsquo;Why?&nbsp; Has he
ever been accused of want of veracity on other subjects?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;No:
he has stood high as a man of probity and honour for years.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Why,
then, throw out his testimony?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Because he lies in this instance,&rsquo; says the adversary:
&lsquo;his testimony does not agree with this and that.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Pardon
me, that is the very point in question,&rsquo; say you: &lsquo;we expect
to prove that it does agree with this and that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Because certain letters of Lady Byron&rsquo;s do not agree with the
&lsquo;Quarterly&rsquo;s&rsquo; theory of the facts of the separation,
it at once assumes that she is an untruthful witness, and proposes to
throw out her evidence altogether.</p>
<p>We propose, on the contrary, to regard Lady Byron&rsquo;s evidence
with all the attention due to the statement of a high-minded conscientious
person, never in any other case accused of violation of truth; we also
propose to show it to be in strict agreement with all well-authenticated
facts and documents; and we propose to treat Lord Byron&rsquo;s evidence
as that of a man of great subtlety, versed in mystification and delighting
in it, and who, on many other subjects, not only deceived, but gloried
in deception; and then we propose to show that it contradicts well-established
facts and received documents.</p>
<p>One thing more we have to say concerning the laws of evidence in
regard to documents presented in this investigation.</p>
<p>This is not a London West-End affair, but a grave historical inquiry,
in which the whole English-speaking world are interested to know the
truth.</p>
<p>As it is now too late to have the securities of a legal trial, certainly
the rules of historical evidence should be strictly observed.&nbsp;
All important documents should be presented in an entire state, with
a plain and open account of their history,&mdash;who had them, where
they were found, and how preserved.</p>
<p>There have been most excellent, credible, and authentic documents
produced in this case; and, as a specimen of them, we shall mention
Lord Lindsay&rsquo;s letter, and the journal and letter it authenticates.&nbsp;
Lord Lindsay at once comes forward, gives his name boldly, gives the
history of the papers he produces, shows how they came to be in his
hands, why never produced before, and why now.&nbsp; We feel confidence
at once.</p>
<p>But in regard to the important series of letters presented as Lady
Byron&rsquo;s, this obviously proper course has not been pursued.&nbsp;
Though assumed to be of the most critical importance, no such distinct
history of them was given in the first instance.&nbsp; The want of such
evidence being noticed by other papers, the &lsquo;Quarterly&rsquo;
appears hurt that the high character of the magazine has not been a
sufficient guarantee; and still deals in vague statements that the letters
have been freely circulated, and that two noblemen of the highest character
would vouch for them if necessary.</p>
<p>In our view, <i>it is necessary</i>.&nbsp; These noblemen should
imitate Lord Lindsay&rsquo;s example,&mdash;give a fair account of these
letters, under their own names; and then, we would add, it is needful
for complete satisfaction to have the letters entire, and not in fragments.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Quarterly&rsquo; gave these letters with the evident implication
that they are entirely destructive to Lady Byron&rsquo;s character as
a witness.&nbsp; Now, has that magazine much reason to be hurt at even
an insinuation on its own character when making such deadly assaults
on that of another?&nbsp; The individuals who bring forth documents
that they suppose to be deadly to the character of a noble person, always
in her generation held to be eminent for virtue, certainly should not
murmur at being called upon to substantiate these documents in the manner
usually expected in historical investigations.</p>
<p>We have shown that these letters do not contradict, but that they
perfectly confirm the facts, and agree with the dates in Lady Byron&rsquo;s
published statements of 1830; and this is our reason for deeming them
authentic.</p>
<p>These considerations with regard to the manner of conducting the
inquiry seem so obviously proper, that we cannot but believe that they
will command a serious attention.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V.&nbsp; THE DIRECT ARGUMENT TO PROVE THE CRIME.</h3>
<p>We shall now proceed to state the argument against Lord Byron.</p>
<p>1st, There is direct evidence that Lord Byron was guilty of some
unusual immorality.</p>
<p>The evidence is not, as the &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; says, that Lushington
yielded assent to the <i>ex parte</i> statement of a client; nor, as
the &lsquo;Quarterly&rsquo; intimates, that he was affected by the charms
of an attractive young woman.</p>
<p>The first evidence of it is the fact that Lushington and Romilly
<i>offered to take the case into court, and make there a public exhibition
of the proofs</i> on which their convictions were founded.</p>
<p>2nd, It is very strong evidence of this fact, that Lord Byron, while
loudly declaring that he wished to know with what he was charged, <i>declined</i>
this open investigation, and, rather than meet it, signed a paper which
he had before refused to sign.</p>
<p>3rd, It is also strong evidence of this fact, that although secretly
declaring to all his intimate friends that he still wished open investigation
in a court of justice, and affirming his belief that his character was
being ruined for want of it, he never afterwards took the means to get
it.&nbsp; Instead of writing a private handbill, he might have come
to England and entered a suit; and he did not do it.</p>
<p>That Lord Byron was conscious of a great crime is further made probable
by the peculiar malice he seemed to bear to his wife&rsquo;s legal counsel.</p>
<p>If there had been nothing to fear in that legal investigation wherewith
they threatened him, why did he not only flee from it, but regard with
a peculiar bitterness those who advised and proposed it?&nbsp; To an
innocent man falsely accused, the certainties of law are a blessing
and a refuge.&nbsp; Female charms cannot mislead in a court of justice;
and the atrocities of rumour are there sifted, and deprived of power.&nbsp;
A trial is not a threat to an innocent man: it is an invitation, an
opportunity.&nbsp; Why, then, did he hate Sir Samuel Romilly, so that
he exulted like a fiend over his tragical death?&nbsp; The letter in
which he pours forth this malignity was so brutal, that Moore was obliged,
by the general outcry of society, to suppress it.&nbsp; Is this the
language of an innocent man who has been offered a fair trial under
his country&rsquo;s laws? or of a guilty man, to whom the very idea
of public trial means public exposure?</p>
<p>4th, It is probable that the crime was the one now alleged, because
that was the most important crime charged against him by rumour at the
period.&nbsp; This appears by the following extract of a letter from
Shelley, furnished by the &lsquo;Quarterly,&rsquo; dated Bath, Sept.
29, 1816:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I saw Kinnaird, and had a long talk with him.&nbsp;
He informed me that Lady Byron was now in perfect health; that she was
living with your sister.&nbsp; I felt much pleasure from this intelligence.&nbsp;
I consider the latter part of it as affording a decisive contradiction
to the only important calumny that ever was advanced against you.&nbsp;
On this ground, at least, it will become the world hereafter to be silent.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears evident here that the charge of improper intimacy with
his sister was, in the mind of Shelley, the only important one that
had yet been made against Lord Byron.</p>
<p>It is fairly inferable, from Lord Byron&rsquo;s own statements, that
his family friends believed this charge.&nbsp; Lady Byron speaks, in
her statement, of &lsquo;nearest relatives&rsquo; and family friends
who were cognizant of Lord Byron&rsquo;s strange conduct at the time
of the separation; and Lord Byron, in the letter to Bowles, before quoted,
says that every one of his relations, except his sister, fell from him
in this crisis like leaves from a tree in autumn.&nbsp; There was, therefore,
not only this report, but such appearances in support of it as convinced
those nearest to the scene, and best apprised of the facts; so that
they fell from him entirely, notwithstanding the strong influence of
family feeling.&nbsp; The Guiccioli book also mentions this same allegation
as having arisen from peculiarities in Lord Byron&rsquo;s manner of
treating his sister:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;This deep, fraternal affection assumed at times,
under the influence of his powerful genius, and under exceptional circumstances,
an almost too passionate expression, which opened a fresh field to his
enemies.&rsquo; <a name="citation219"></a><a href="#footnote219">{219}</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears, then, that there was nothing in the character of Lord
Byron and of his sister, as they appeared before their generation, that
prevented such a report from arising: on the contrary, there was something
in their relations that made it seem probable.&nbsp; And it appears
that his own family friends were so affected by it, that they, with
one accord, deserted him.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Quarterly&rsquo; presents
the fact that Lady Byron went to visit Mrs. Leigh at this time, as triumphant
proof that <i>she</i> did not then believe it.&nbsp; Can the &lsquo;Quarterly&rsquo;
show just what Lady Byron&rsquo;s state of mind was, or what her motives
were, in making that visit?</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Quarterly&rsquo; seems to assume, that no woman, without
gross hypocrisy, can stand by a sister proven to have been guilty.&nbsp;
We can appeal on this subject to all women.&nbsp; We fearlessly ask
any wife, &lsquo;Supposing your husband and sister were involved together
in an infamous crime, and that you were the mother of a young daughter
whose life would be tainted by a knowledge of that crime, what would
be your wish?&nbsp; Would you wish to proclaim it forthwith? or would
you wish quietly to separate from your husband, and to cover the crime
from the eye of man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It has been proved that Lady Byron did not reveal this even to her
nearest relatives.&nbsp; It is proved that she sealed the mouths of
her counsel, and even of servants, so effectually, that they remain
sealed even to this day.&nbsp; This is evidence that she did not wish
the thing known.&nbsp; It is proved also, that, in spite of her secrecy
with her parents and friends, the rumour got out, and was spoken of
by Shelley as the <i>only</i> important one.</p>
<p>Now, let us see how this note, cited by the &lsquo;Quarterly,&rsquo;
confirms one of Lady Byron&rsquo;s own statements.&nbsp; She says to
Lady Anne Barnard,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I trust you understand my wishes, which never
were to injure Lord Byron in any way; for, though he would not suffer
me to remain his wife, he cannot prevent me from continuing his friend;
and it was from considering myself as such that I silenced the accusations
by which my own conduct might have been more fully justified.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How did Lady Byron <i>silence accusations</i>?&nbsp; First, by keeping
silence to her nearest relatives; second, by shutting the mouths of
servants; third, by imposing silence on her friends,&mdash;as Lady Anne
Barnard; fourth, by silencing her legal counsel; fifth, and most entirely,
by treating Mrs. Leigh, before the world, with unaltered kindness.&nbsp;
In the midst of the rumours, Lady Byron went to visit her; and Shelley
says that the movement was effectual.&nbsp; Can the &lsquo;Quarterly&rsquo;
prove that, at this time, Mrs. Leigh had not confessed all, and thrown
herself on Lady Byron&rsquo;s mercy?</p>
<p>It is not necessary to suppose great horror and indignation on the
part of Lady Byron.&nbsp; She may have regarded her sister as the victim
of a most singularly powerful tempter.&nbsp; Lord Byron, as she knew,
had tried to corrupt her own morals and faith.&nbsp; He had obtained
a power over some women, even in the highest circles in England, which
had led them to forego the usual decorums of their sex, and had given
rise to great scandals.&nbsp; He was a being of wonderful personal attractions.&nbsp;
He had not only strong poetical, but also strong logical power.&nbsp;
He was daring in speculation, and vigorous in sophistical argument;
beautiful, dazzling, and possessed of magnetic power of fascination.&nbsp;
His sister had been kind and considerate to Lady Byron when Lord Byron
was brutal and cruel.&nbsp; She had been overcome by him, as a weaker
nature sometimes sinks under the force of a stronger one; and Lady Byron
may really have considered her to be more sinned against than sinning.</p>
<p>Lord Byron, if we look at it rightly, did not corrupt Mrs. Leigh
any more than he did the whole British public.&nbsp; They rebelled at
the immorality of his conduct and the obscenity of his writings; and
he resolved that they should accept both.&nbsp; And he made them do
it.&nbsp; At first, they execrated &lsquo;Don Juan.&rsquo;&nbsp; Murray
was afraid to publish it.&nbsp; Women were determined not to read it.&nbsp;
In 1819, Dr. William Maginn of the Noctes wrote a song against it in
the following virtuous strain:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Be &ldquo;Juan,&rdquo; then, unseen, unknown;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It must, or we shall rue it.<br />
We may have virtue of our own:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah! why should we undo it?<br />
The treasured faith of days long past<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We still would prize o&rsquo;er any,<br />
And grieve to hear the ribald jeer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of scamps like Don Giovanni.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lord Byron determined to conquer the virtuous scruples of the Noctes
Club; and so we find this same Dr. William Maginn, who in 1819 wrote
so valiantly, in 1822 declaring that he would rather have written a
page of &lsquo;Don Juan&rsquo; than a ton of &lsquo;Childe Harold.&rsquo;&nbsp;
All English morals were, in like manner, formally surrendered to Lord
Byron.&nbsp; Moore details his adulteries in Venice with unabashed particularity:
artists send for pictures of his principal mistresses; the literary
world call for biographical sketches of their points; Moore compares
his wife and his last mistress in a neatly-turned sentence; and yet
the professor of morals in Edinburgh University recommends the biography
as <i>pure</i>, and having no mud in it.&nbsp; The mistress is lionized
in London; and in 1869 is introduced to the world of letters by &lsquo;Blackwood,&rsquo;
and bid, &lsquo;without a blush, to say she loved&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>This much being done to all England, it is quite possible that a
woman like Lady Byron, standing silently aside and surveying the course
of things, may have thought that Mrs. Leigh was no more seduced than
all the rest of the world, and have said as we feel disposed to say
of that generation, and of a good many in this, &lsquo;Let him that
is without sin among you cast the first stone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The peculiar bitterness of remorse expressed in his works by Lord
Byron is a further evidence that he had committed an unusual crime.&nbsp;
We are aware that evidence cannot be drawn in this manner from an author&rsquo;s
works merely, if unsupported by any external probability.&nbsp; For
example, the subject most frequently and powerfully treated by Hawthorne
is the influence of a secret, unconfessed crime on the soul: nevertheless,
as Hawthorne is well known to have always lived a pure and regular life,
nobody has ever suspected him of any greater sin than a vigorous imagination.&nbsp;
But here is a man believed guilty of an uncommon immorality by the two
best lawyers in England, and threatened with an open exposure, which
he does not dare to meet.&nbsp; The crime is named in society; his own
relations fall away from him on account of it; it is only set at rest
by the heroic conduct of his wife.&nbsp; Now, this man is stated by
many of his friends to have had all the appearance of a man secretly
labouring under the consciousness of crime.&nbsp; Moore speaks of this
propensity in the following language:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I have known him more than once, as we sat together
after dinner, and he was a little under the influence of wine, to fall
seriously into this dark, self-accusing mood, and throw out hints of
his past life with an air of gloom and mystery designed evidently to
awaken curiosity and interest.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moore says that it was his own custom to dispel these appearances
by ridicule, to which his friend was keenly alive.&nbsp; And he goes
on to say,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;It has sometimes occurred to me, that the occult
causes of his lady&rsquo;s separation from him, round which herself
and her legal advisers have thrown such formidable mystery, may have
been nothing more than some imposture of this kind, some dimly-hinted
confession of undefined horror, which, though intended by the relater
to mystify and surprise, the hearer so little understood as to take
in sober seriousness.&rsquo; <a name="citation225"></a><a href="#footnote225">{225}</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>All we have to say is, that Lord Byron&rsquo;s conduct in this respect
is exactly what might have been expected if he had a crime on his conscience.</p>
<p>The energy of remorse and despair expressed in &lsquo;Manfred&rsquo;
were so appalling and so vividly <i>personal</i>, that the belief was
universal on the Continent that the experience was wrought out of some
actual crime.&nbsp; Goethe expressed this idea, and had heard a murder
imputed to Byron as the cause.</p>
<p>The allusion to the crime and consequences of incest is so plain
in &lsquo;Manfred,&rsquo; that it is astonishing that any one can pretend,
as Galt does, that it had any other application.</p>
<p>The hero speaks of the love between himself and the imaginary being
whose spirit haunts him as having been the <i>deadliest</i> sin, and
one that has, perhaps, caused her eternal destruction.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;What is she now?&nbsp; A sufferer for my sins;<br />
A thing I dare not think upon.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He speaks of her blood as haunting him, and as being</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;My blood,&mdash;the pure, warm
stream<br />
That ran in the veins of my fathers, and in ours<br />
When we were in our youth, and had one heart,<br />
And loved each other as we should not love.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This work was conceived in the commotion of mind immediately following
his separation.&nbsp; The scenery of it was sketched in a journal sent
to his sister at the time.</p>
<p>In letter 377, defending the originality of the conception, and showing
that it did not arise from reading &lsquo;Faust,&rsquo; he says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;It was the Steinbach and the Jungfrau, and something
else, more than Faustus, that made me write &ldquo;Manfred.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In letter 288, speaking of the various accounts given by critics
of the origin of the story, he says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The conjecturer is out, and knows nothing of the
matter.&nbsp; I had a better origin than he could devise or divine for
the soul of him.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In letter 299, he says:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As to the germs of &ldquo;Manfred,&rdquo; they may be found
in the journal I sent to Mrs. Leigh, part of which you saw.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It may be said, plausibly, that Lord Byron, if conscious of this
crime, would not have expressed it in his poetry.&nbsp; But his nature
was such that he could not help it.&nbsp; Whatever he wrote that had
any real power was generally wrought out of self; and, when in a tumult
of emotion, he could not help giving glimpses of the cause.&nbsp; It
appears that he did know that he had been accused of incest, and that
Shelley thought <i>that</i> accusation the only really important one;
and yet, sensitive as he was to blame and reprobation, he ran upon this
very subject most likely to re-awaken scandal.</p>
<p>But Lord Byron&rsquo;s strategy was always of the bold kind.&nbsp;
It was the plan of the fugitive, who, instead of running away, stations
himself so near to danger, that nobody would ever think of looking for
him there.&nbsp; He published passionate verses to his sister on this
principle.&nbsp; He imitated the security of an innocent man in every
thing but the unconscious energy of the agony which seized him when
he gave vent to his nature in poetry.&nbsp; The boldness of his strategy
is evident through all his life.&nbsp; He began by charging his wife
with the very cruelty and deception which he was himself practising.&nbsp;
He had spread a net for her feet, and he accused her of spreading a
net for his.&nbsp; He had placed her in a position where she could not
speak, and then leisurely shot arrows at her; and he represented her
as having done the same by him.&nbsp; When he attacked her in &lsquo;Don
Juan,&rsquo; and strove to take from her the very protection <a name="citation227"></a><a href="#footnote227">{227}</a>of
womanly sacredness by putting her name into the mouth of every ribald,
he did a bold thing, and he knew it.&nbsp; He meant to do a bold thing.&nbsp;
There was a general outcry against it; and he fought it down, and gained
his point.&nbsp; By sheer boldness and perseverance, he turned the public
<i>from</i> his wife, and <i>to</i> himself, in the face of their very
groans and protests.&nbsp; His &lsquo;Manfred&rsquo; and his &lsquo;Cain&rsquo;
were parts of the same game.&nbsp; But the involuntary cry of remorse
and despair pierced even through his own artifices, in a manner that
produced a conviction of reality.</p>
<p>His evident fear and hatred of his wife were other symptoms of crime.&nbsp;
There was no apparent occasion for him to hate her.&nbsp; He admitted
that she had been bright, amiable, good, agreeable; that her marriage
had been a very uncomfortable one; and he said to Madame de Sta&euml;l,
that he did not doubt she thought him deranged.&nbsp; Why, then, did
he hate her for wanting to live peaceably by herself?&nbsp; Why did
he so fear her, that not one year of his life passed without his concocting
and circulating some public or private accusation against her?&nbsp;
She, by his own showing, published none against him.&nbsp; It is remarkable,
that, in all his zeal to represent himself injured, he nowhere quotes
a single remark from Lady Byron, nor a story coming either directly
or indirectly from her or her family.&nbsp; He is in a fever in Venice,
not from what she has spoken, but because she has sealed the lips of
her counsel, and because she and her family do not speak: so that he
professes himself utterly ignorant what form her allegations against
him may take.&nbsp; He had heard from Shelley that his wife silenced
the most important calumny by going to make Mrs. Leigh a visit; and
yet he is afraid of her,&mdash;so afraid, that he tells Moore he expects
she will attack him after death, and charges him to defend his grave.</p>
<p>Now, if Lord Byron knew that his wife had a deadly secret that she
could tell, all this conduct is explicable: it is in the ordinary course
of human nature.&nbsp; Men always distrust those who hold facts by which
they can be ruined.&nbsp; They fear them; they are antagonistic to them;
they cannot trust them.&nbsp; The feeling of Falkland to Caleb Williams,
as portrayed in Godwin&rsquo;s masterly sketch, is perfectly natural,
and it is exactly illustrative of what Byron felt for his wife.&nbsp;
He hated her for having his secret; and, so far as a human being could
do it, he tried to destroy her character before the world, that she
might not have the power to testify against him.&nbsp; If we admit this
solution, Byron&rsquo;s conduct is at least that of a man who is acting
as men ordinarily would act under such circumstances: if we do not,
he is acting like a fiend.&nbsp; Let us look at admitted facts.&nbsp;
He married his wife without love, in a gloomy, melancholy, morose state
of mind.&nbsp; The servants testify to strange, unaccountable treatment
of her immediately after marriage; such that her confidential maid advises
her return to her parents.&nbsp; In Lady Byron&rsquo;s letter to Mrs.
Leigh, she reminds Lord Byron that he always expressed a desire and
determination to free himself from the marriage.&nbsp; Lord Byron himself
admits to Madame de Sta&euml;l that his behaviour was such, that his
wife must have thought him insane.&nbsp; Now we are asked to believe,
that simply because, under these circumstances, Lady Byron wished to
live separate from her husband, he hated and feared her so that he could
never let her alone afterwards; that he charged her with malice, slander,
deceit, and deadly intentions against himself, merely out of spite,
because she preferred not to live with him.&nbsp; This last view of
the case certainly makes Lord Byron more unaccountably wicked than the
other.</p>
<p>The first supposition shows him to us as a man in an agony of self-preservation;
the second as a fiend, delighting in gratuitous deceit and cruelty.</p>
<p>Again: a presumption of this crime appears in Lord Byron&rsquo;s
admission, in a letter to Moore, that he had an illegitimate child born
before he left England, and still living at the time.</p>
<p>In letter 307, to Mr. Moore, under date Venice, Feb. 2, 1818, Byron
says, speaking of Moore&rsquo;s loss of a child,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I know how to feel with you, because I am quite
wrapped up in my own children.&nbsp; Besides my little legitimate, I
have made unto myself an illegitimate since [since Ada&rsquo;s birth]
to say nothing of one before; and I look forward to one of these as
the pillar of my old age, supposing that I ever reach, as I hope I never
shall, that desolating period.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The illegitimate child that he had made to himself since Ada&rsquo;s
birth was Allegra, born about nine or ten months after the separation.&nbsp;
The other illegitimate alluded to was born before, and, as the reader
sees, was spoken of as still living.</p>
<p>Moore appears to be puzzled to know who this child can be, and conjectures
that it may possibly be the child referred to in an early poem, written,
while a schoolboy of nineteen, at Harrow.</p>
<p>On turning back to the note referred to, we find two things: first,
that the child there mentioned was not claimed by Lord Byron as his
own, but that he asked his mother to care for it as belonging to a schoolmate
now dead; second, that the infant died shortly after, and, consequently,
could not be the child mentioned in this letter.</p>
<p>Now, besides this fact, that Lord Byron admitted a living illegitimate
child born before Ada, we place this other fact, that there was a child
in England which was believed to be his by those who had every opportunity
of knowing.</p>
<p>On this subject we shall cite a passage from a letter recently received
by us from England, and written by a person who appears well informed
on the subject of his letter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The fact is, the incest was first committed, and
the child of it born before, shortly before, the Byron marriage.&nbsp;
The child (a daughter) must not be confounded with the natural daughter
of Lord Byron, born about a year after his separation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The history, more or less, of that child of incest, is known
to many; for in Lady Byron&rsquo;s attempts to watch over her, and rescue
her from ruin, she was compelled to employ various agents at different
times.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter contains a full recognition, by an intelligent person
in England, of a child corresponding well with Lord Byron&rsquo;s declaration
of an illegitimate, born before he left England.</p>
<p>Up to this point, we have, then, the circumstantial evidence against
Lord Byron as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>A good and amiable woman, who had married him from love, determined
to separate from him.</p>
<p>Two of the greatest lawyers of England confirmed her in this decision,
and threatened Lord Byron, that, unless he consented to this, they would
expose the evidence against him in a suit for divorce.&nbsp; He fled
from this exposure, and never afterwards sought public investigation.</p>
<p>He was angry with and malicious towards the counsel who supported
his wife; he was angry at and afraid of a wife who did nothing to injure
him, and he made it a special object to defame and degrade her.&nbsp;
He gave such evidence of remorse and fear in his writings as to lead
eminent literary men to believe he had committed a great crime.&nbsp;
The public rumour of his day specified what the crime was.&nbsp; His
relations, by his own showing, joined against him.&nbsp; The report
was silenced by his wife&rsquo;s efforts only.&nbsp; Lord Byron subsequently
declares the existence of an illegitimate child, born before he left
England.&nbsp; Corresponding to this, there is the history, known in
England, of a child believed to be his, in whom his wife took an interest.</p>
<p>All these presumptions exist independently of any direct testimony
from Lady Byron.&nbsp; They are to be admitted as true, whether she
says a word one way or the other.</p>
<p>From this background of proof, I come forward, and testify to an
interview with Lady Byron, in which she gave me specific information
of the facts in the case.&nbsp; That I report the facts just as I received
them from her, not altered or misremembered, is shown by the testimony
of my sister, to whom I related them at the time.&nbsp; It cannot, then,
be denied that I had this interview, and that this communication was
made.&nbsp; I therefore testify that Lady Byron, for a proper purpose,
and at a proper time, stated to me the following things:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That the crime which separated her from Lord Byron was incest.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That she first discovered it by improper actions towards
his sister, which, he <i>meant</i> to make her understand, indicated
the guilty relation.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; That he admitted it, reasoned on it, defended it, tried
to make her an accomplice, and, failing in that, hated her and expelled
her.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; That he threatened her that he would make it his life&rsquo;s
object to destroy her character.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; That for a period she was led to regard this conduct as
insanity, and to consider him only as a diseased person.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; That she had subsequent proof that the facts were really
as she suspected; that there had been a child born of the crime, whose
history she knew; that Mrs. Leigh had repented.</p>
<p>The purpose for which this was stated to me was to ask, Was it her
duty to make the truth fully known during her lifetime?</p>
<p>Here, then, is a man believed guilty of an unusual crime by two lawyers,
the best in England, who have seen the evidence,&mdash;a man who dares
not meet legal investigation.&nbsp; The crime is named in society, and
deemed so far probable to the men of his generation as to be spoken
of by Shelley as the only important allegation against him.&nbsp; He
acts through life exactly like a man struggling with remorse, and afraid
of detection; he has all the restlessness and hatred and fear that a
man has who feels that there is evidence which might destroy him.&nbsp;
He admits an illegitimate child besides Allegra.&nbsp; A child believed
to have been his is known to many in England.&nbsp; Added to all this,
his widow, now advanced in years, and standing on the borders of eternity,
being, as appears by her writings and conversation, of perfectly sound
mind at the time, testifies to me the facts before named, which exactly
correspond to probabilities.</p>
<p>I publish the statement; and the solicitors who hold Lady Byron&rsquo;s
private papers do not deny the truth of the story.&nbsp; They try to
cast discredit on me for speaking; but they do not say that I have spoken
falsely, or that the story is not true.&nbsp; The lawyer who knew Lady
Byron&rsquo;s story in 1816 does not now deny that this is the true
one.&nbsp; Several persons in England testify that, at various times,
and for various purposes, the same story has been told to them.&nbsp;
Moreover, it appears from my last letter addressed to Lady Byron on
this subject, that I recommended her to leave <i>all necessary papers</i>
in the hands of some discreet persons, who, after <i>both</i> had passed
away, should see that justice was done.&nbsp; The solicitors admit that
Lady Byron <i>has</i> left sealed papers of great importance in the
hands of trustees, with discretionary power.&nbsp; I have been informed
very directly that the nature of these documents was such as to lead
to the suppression of Lady Byron&rsquo;s life and writings.&nbsp; This
is all exactly as it would be, if the story related by Lady Byron were
the true one.</p>
<p>The evidence under this point of view is so strong, that a great
effort has been made to throw out Lady Byron&rsquo;s testimony.</p>
<p>This attempt has been made on two grounds.&nbsp; 1st, That she was
under a mental hallucination.&nbsp; This theory has been most ably refuted
by the very first authority in England upon the subject.&nbsp; He says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;No person practically acquainted with the true
characteristics of insanity would affirm, that, had this idea of &ldquo;incest&rdquo;
been an insane hallucination, Lady Byron could, from the lengthened
period which intervened between her unhappy marriage and death, have
refrained from exhibiting it, not only to legal advisers and trustees
(assuming that she revealed to them the fact), but to others, exacting
no pledge of secrecy from them as to her mental impressions.&nbsp; Lunatics
do for a time, and for some special purpose, most cunningly conceal
their delusions; but they have not the capacity to struggle for thirty-six
years, as Lady Byron must have done, with so frightful an hallucination,
without the insane state of mind becoming obvious to those with whom
they are daily associating.&nbsp; Neither is it consistent with experience
to suppose, that, if Lady Byron had been a monomaniac, her state of
disordered understanding would have been restricted to one hallucination.&nbsp;
Her diseased brain, affecting the normal action of thought, would, in
all probability, have manifested other symptoms besides those referred
to of aberration of intellect.</p>
<p>&lsquo;During the last thirty years, I have not met with a case of
insanity (assuming the hypothesis of hallucination) at all parallel
with that of Lady Byron.&nbsp; In my experience, it is unique.&nbsp;
I never saw a patient with such a delusion.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We refer our readers to a careful study of Dr. Forbes Winslow&rsquo;s
consideration of this subject given in Part III.&nbsp; Anyone who has
been familiar with the delicacy and acuteness of Dr. Winslow, as shown
in his work on obscure diseases of the brain and nerves, must feel that
his positive assertion on this ground is the best possible evidence.&nbsp;
We here gratefully acknowledge our obligations to Dr. Winslow for the
corrected proof of his valuable letter, which he has done us the honour
to send for this work.&nbsp; We shall consider that his argument, in
connection with what the reader may observe of Lady Byron&rsquo;s own
writings, closes that issue of the case completely.</p>
<p>The other alternative is, that Lady Byron deliberately committed
false witness.&nbsp; This was the ground assumed by the &lsquo;Blackwood,&rsquo;
when in July, 1869, it took upon itself the responsibility of re-opening
the Byron controversy.&nbsp; It is also the ground assumed by &lsquo;The
London Quarterly&rsquo; of to-day.</p>
<p>Both say, in so many words, that no crime was imputed to Lord Byron;
that the representations made to Lushington in the beginning were false
ones; and that the story told to Lady Byron&rsquo;s confidential friends
in later days was also false.</p>
<p>Let us examine this theory.&nbsp; In the first place, it requires
us to believe in the existence of a moral monster of whom Madame Brinvilliers
is cited as the type.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Blackwood,&rsquo; let it be remembered,
opens the controversy with the statement that Lady Byron was a Madame
Brinvilliers.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Quarterly&rsquo; does not shrink from
the same assumption.</p>
<p>Let us consider the probability of this question.</p>
<p>If Lady Byron were such a woman, and wished to ruin her husband&rsquo;s
reputation in order to save her own, and, being perfectly unscrupulous,
had circulated against him a story of unnatural crime which had no proofs,
how came two of the first lawyers of England to assume the responsibility
of offering to present her case in open court?&nbsp; How came her husband,
if he knew himself guiltless, to shrink from that public investigation
which must have demonstrated his innocence?&nbsp; Most astonishing of
all, when he fled from trial, and the report got abroad against him
in England, and was believed even by his own relations, why did not
his wife avail herself of the moment to complete her victory?&nbsp;
If at that moment she had publicly broken with Mrs. Leigh, she might
have confirmed every rumour.&nbsp; Did she do it? and why not?&nbsp;
According to the &lsquo;Blackwood,&rsquo; we have here a woman who has
made up a frightful story to ruin her husband&rsquo;s reputation, yet
who takes every pains afterwards to prevent its being ruined.&nbsp;
She fails to do the very thing she undertakes; and for years after,
rather than injure him, she loses public sympathy, and, by sealing the
lips of her legal counsel, deprives herself of the advantage of their
testimony.</p>
<p>Moreover, if a desire for revenge could have been excited in her,
it would have been provoked by the first publication of the fourth canto
of &lsquo;Childe Harold,&rsquo; when she felt that Byron was attacking
her before the world.&nbsp; Yet we have Lady Anne Barnard&rsquo;s testimony,
that, at this time, she was so far from wishing to injure him, that
all her communications were guarded by cautious secrecy.&nbsp; At this
time, also, she had a strong party in England, to whom she could have
appealed.&nbsp; Again: when &lsquo;Don Juan&rsquo; was first printed,
it excited a violent re-action against Lord Byron.&nbsp; Had his wife
chosen <i>then</i> to accuse him, and display the evidence she had shown
to her counsel, there is little doubt that all the world would have
stood with her; but she did not.&nbsp; After his death, when she spoke
at last, there seems little doubt from the strength of Dr. Lushington&rsquo;s
language, that Lady Byron had a very strong case, and that, had she
been willing, her counsel could have told much more than he did.&nbsp;
She might <i>then</i> have told her whole story, and been believed.&nbsp;
Her word was believed by Christopher North, and accepted as proof that
Byron had been a great criminal.&nbsp; Had revenge been her motive,
she could have spoken the ONE WORD more that North called for.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Quarterly&rsquo; asks why she waited till everybody concerned
was dead.&nbsp; There is an obvious answer.&nbsp; Because, while there
was anybody living to whom the testimony would have been utterly destructive,
there were the best reasons for withholding it.&nbsp; When all were
gone from earth, and she herself was in constant expectation of passing
away, there <i>was</i> a reason, and a proper one, why she should speak.&nbsp;
By nature and principle truthful, she had had the opportunity of silently
watching the operation of a permitted lie upon a whole generation.&nbsp;
She had been placed in a position in which it was necessary, by silence,
to allow the spread and propagation through society of a radical falsehood.&nbsp;
Lord Byron&rsquo;s life, fame, and genius had all struck their roots
into this lie, been nourished by it, and had derived thence a poisonous
power.</p>
<p>In reading this history, it will be remarked that he pleaded his
personal misfortunes in his marriage as excuses for every offence against
morality, and that the literary world of England accepted the plea,
and tolerated and justified the crimes.&nbsp; Never before, in England,
had adultery been spoken of in so respectful a manner, and an adulteress
openly praised and <i>f&ecirc;ted</i>, and obscene language and licentious
images publicly tolerated; and all on the plea of a man&rsquo;s private
misfortunes.</p>
<p>There was, therefore, great force in the suggestion made to Lady
Byron, that she owed a testimony in this case to truth and justice,
irrespective of any personal considerations.&nbsp; There is no more
real reason for allowing the spread of a hurtful falsehood that affects
ourselves than for allowing one that affects our neighbour.&nbsp; This
falsehood had corrupted the literature and morals of both England and
America, and led to the public toleration, by respectable authorities,
of forms of vice at first indignantly rejected.&nbsp; The question was,
Was this falsehood to go on corrupting literature as long as history
lasted?&nbsp; Had the world no right to true history?&nbsp; Had she
who possessed the truth no responsibility to the world?&nbsp; Was not
a final silence a confirmation of a lie with all its consequences?</p>
<p>This testimony of Lady Byron, so far from being thrown out altogether,
as the &lsquo;Quarterly&rsquo; proposes, has a peculiar and specific
value from the great forbearance and reticence which characterised the
greater part of her life.</p>
<p>The testimony of a person who has shown in every action perfect friendliness
to another comes with the more weight on that account.&nbsp; Testimony
extorted by conscience from a parent against a child, or a wife against
a husband, where all the other actions of the life prove the existence
of kind feeling, is held to be the strongest form of evidence.</p>
<p>The fact that Lady Byron, under the severest temptations and the
bitterest insults and injuries, withheld every word by which Lord Byron
could be criminated, so long as he and his sister were living, is strong
evidence, that, when she did speak, it was not under the influence of
ill-will, but of pure conscientious convictions; and the fullest weight
ought, therefore, to be given to her testimony.</p>
<p>We are asked now why she ever spoke at all.&nbsp; The fact that her
story is known to several persons in England is brought up as if it
were a crime.&nbsp; To this we answer, Lady Byron had an undoubted moral
right to have exposed the whole story in a public court in 1816, and
thus cut herself loose from her husband by a divorce.&nbsp; For the
sake of saving her husband and sister from destruction, she waived this
right to self-justification, and stood for years a silent sufferer under
calumny and misrepresentation.&nbsp; She desired nothing but to retire
from the whole subject; to be permitted to enjoy with her child the
peace and seclusion that belong to her sex.&nbsp; Her husband made her,
through his life and after his death, a subject of such constant discussion,
that she must either abandon the current literature of her day, or run
the risk of reading more or less about herself in almost every magazine
of her time.&nbsp; Conversations with Lord Byron, notes of interviews
with Lord Byron, journals of time spent with Lord Byron, were constantly
spread before the public.&nbsp; Leigh Hunt, Galt, Medwin, Trelawney,
Lady Blessington, Dr. Kennedy, and Thomas Moore, all poured forth their
memorials; and in all she figured prominently.&nbsp; All these had their
tribes of reviewers and critics, who also discussed her.&nbsp; The profound
mystery of her silence seemed constantly to provoke inquiry.&nbsp; People
could not forgive her for not speaking.&nbsp; Her privacy, retirement,
and silence were set down as coldness, haughtiness, and contempt of
human sympathy.&nbsp; She was constantly challenged to say something:
as, for example, in the &lsquo;Noctes&rsquo; of November 1825, six months
after Byron&rsquo;s death, Christopher North says, speaking of the burning
of the Autobiography,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I think, since the Memoir was burned by these
people, these people are bound to put us in possession of the best evidence
they still have the power of producing, in order that we may come to
a just conclusion as to a subject upon which, by their act, at least,
as much as by any other people&rsquo;s act, we are compelled to consider
it our duty to make up our deliberate opinion,&mdash;deliberate and
decisive.&nbsp; Woe be to those who provoke this curiosity, and will
not allay it!&nbsp; Woe be to them! say I.&nbsp; Woe to them! says the
world.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Lady Byron published her statement, which certainly seemed called
for by this language, Christopher North blamed her for doing it, and
then again said that she ought to go on and tell the whole story.&nbsp;
If she was thus adjured to speak, blamed for speaking, and adjured to
speak further, all in one breath, by public prints, there is reason
to think that there could not have come less solicitation from private
sources,&mdash;from friends who had access to her at all hours, whom
she loved, by whom she was beloved, and to whom her refusal to explain
might seem a breach of friendship.&nbsp; Yet there is no evidence on
record, that we have seen, that she ever had other confidant than her
legal counsel, till after all the actors in the events were in their
graves, and the daughter, for whose sake largely the secret was guarded,
had followed them.</p>
<p>Now, does anyone claim, that, because a woman has sacrificed for
twenty years all cravings for human sympathy, and all possibility of
perfectly free and unconstrained intercourse with her friends, that
she is obliged to go on bearing this same lonely burden to the end of
her days?</p>
<p>Let anyone imagine the frightful constraint and solitude implied
in this sentence.&nbsp; Let anyone, too, think of its painful complications
in life.&nbsp; The roots of a falsehood are far-reaching.&nbsp; Conduct
that can only be explained by criminating another must often seem unreasonable
and unaccountable; and the most truthful person, who feels bound to
keep silence regarding a radical lie of another, must often be placed
in positions most trying to conscientiousness.&nbsp; The great merit
of &lsquo;Caleb Williams&rsquo; as a novel consists in its philosophical
analysis of the utter helplessness of an innocent person who agrees
to keep the secret of a guilty one.&nbsp; One sees there how that necessity
of silence produces all the effect of falsehood on his part, and deprives
him of the confidence and sympathy of those with whom he would take
refuge.</p>
<p>For years, this unnatural life was forced on Lady Byron, involving
her as in a network, even in her dearest family relations.</p>
<p>That, when all the parties were dead, Lady Byron should allow herself
the sympathy of a circle of intimate friends, is something so perfectly
proper and natural, that we cannot but wonder that her conduct in this
respect has ever been called in question.&nbsp; If it was her right
to have had a public <i>expos&eacute;</i> in 1816, it was certainly
her right to show to her own intimate circle the secret of her life
when all the principal actors were passed from earth.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Quarterly&rsquo; speaks as if, by thus waiting, she deprived
Lord Byron of the testimony of living witnesses.&nbsp; But there were
as many witnesses and partisans dead on her side as on his.&nbsp; Lady
Milbanke and Sir Ralph, Sir Samuel Romilly and Lady Anne Barnard were
as much dead as Hobhouse, Moore, and others of Byron&rsquo;s partisans.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Quarterly&rsquo; speaks of Lady Byron as &lsquo;running
round, and repeating her story to people mostly below her own rank in
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To those who know the personal dignity of Lady Byron&rsquo;s manners,
represented and dwelt on by her husband in his conversations with Lady
Blessington, this coarse and vulgar attack only proves the poverty of
a cause which can defend itself by no better weapons.</p>
<p>Lord Byron speaks of his wife as &lsquo;highly cultivated;&rsquo;
as having &lsquo;a degree of self-control I never saw equalled.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I am certain,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;that Lady
Byron&rsquo;s first idea is what is due to herself: I mean that it is
the undeviating rule of her conduct . . . .&nbsp; Now, my besetting
sin is a want of that self-respect which she has in excess . . . .&nbsp;
But, though I accuse Lady Byron of an excess of self-respect, I must,
in candour, admit, that, if any person ever had excuse for an extraordinary
portion of it, she has; as, in all her thoughts, words, and actions,
she is the most decorous woman that ever existed.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the kind of woman who has lately been accused in the public
prints as a babbler of secrets and a gossip in regard to her private
difficulties with children, grandchildren, and servants.&nbsp; It is
a fair specimen of the justice that has generally been meted out to
Lady Byron.</p>
<p>In 1836, she was accused of having made a confidant of Campbell,
on the strength of having written him a note <i>declining</i> to give
him any information, or answer any questions.&nbsp; In July, 1869, she
was denounced by &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; as a Madame Brinvilliers for
keeping such perfect silence on the matter of her husband&rsquo;s character;
and in the last &lsquo;Quarterly&rsquo; she is spoken of as a gossip
&lsquo;running round, and repeating her story to people below her in
rank.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While we are upon this subject, we have a suggestion to make.&nbsp;
John Stuart Mill says that utter self-abnegation has been preached to
women as a peculiarly feminine virtue.&nbsp; It is true; but there is
a moral limit to the value of self-abnegation.</p>
<p>It is a fair question for the moralist, whether it is right and proper
wholly to ignore one&rsquo;s personal claims to justice.&nbsp; The teachings
of the Saviour give us warrant for submitting to personal injuries;
but both the Saviour and St. Paul manifested bravery in denying false
accusations, and asserting innocence.</p>
<p>Lady Byron was falsely accused of having ruined <i>the</i> man of
his generation, and caused all his vices and crimes, and all their evil
effects on society.&nbsp; She submitted to the accusation for a certain
number of years for reasons which commended themselves to her conscience;
but when all the personal considerations were removed, and she was about
passing from life, it was right, it was just, it was strictly in accordance
with the philosophical and ethical character of her mind, and with her
habit of considering all things in their widest relations to the good
of mankind, that she should give serious attention and consideration
to the last duty which she might owe to abstract truth and justice in
her generation.</p>
<p>In her letter on the religious state of England, we find her advocating
an absolute frankness in all religious parties.&nbsp; She would have
all openly confess those doubts, which, from the best of motives, are
usually suppressed; and believed, that, as a result of such perfect
truthfulness, a wider love would prevail among Christians.&nbsp; This
shows the strength of her conviction of the power and the importance
of absolute truth; and shows, therefore, that her doubts and conscientious
inquiries respecting her duty on this subject are exactly what might
have been expected from a person of her character and principles.</p>
<p>Having thus shown that Lady Byron&rsquo;s testimony is the testimony
of a woman of strong and sound mind, that it was not given from malice
nor ill-will, that it was given at a proper time and in a proper manner,
and for a purpose in accordance with the most elevated moral views,
and that it is coincident with all the established facts of this history,
and furnishes a perfect solution of every mystery of the case, we think
we shall carry the reader with us in saying that it is to be received
as absolute truth.</p>
<p>This conviction we arrive at while as yet we are deprived of the
statement prepared by Lady Byron, and the proof by which she expected
to sustain it; both which, as we understand, are now in the hands of
her trustees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI.&nbsp; PHYSIOLOGICAL ARGUMENT.</h3>
<p>The credibility of the accusation of the unnatural crime charged
to Lord Byron is greater than if charged to most men.&nbsp; He was born
of parents both of whom were remarkable for perfectly ungoverned passions.&nbsp;
There appears to be historical evidence that he was speaking literal
truth when he says to Medwin of his father,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;He would have made a bad hero for Hannah More.&nbsp;
He ran out three fortunes, and married or ran away with three women
. . .&nbsp; He seemed born for his own ruin and that of the other sex.&nbsp;
He began by seducing Lady Carmarthen, and spent her four thousand pounds;
and, not content with one adventure of this kind, afterwards eloped
with Miss Gordon.&rsquo;&mdash;Medwin&rsquo;s Conversations, p.31.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lady Carmarthen here spoken of was the mother of Mrs. Leigh.&nbsp;
Miss Gordon became Lord Byron&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>By his own account, and that of Moore, she was a passionate, ungoverned,
though affectionate woman.&nbsp; Lord Byron says to Medwin,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I lost my father when I was only six years of
age.&nbsp; My mother, when she was in a passion with me (and I gave
her cause enough), used to say, &ldquo;O you little dog! you are a Byron
all over; you are as bad as your father!&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash;Ibid.,
p.37.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By all the accounts of his childhood and early youth, it is made
apparent that ancestral causes had sent him into the world with a most
perilous and exceptional sensitiveness of brain and nervous system,
which it would have required the most judicious course of education
to direct safely and happily.</p>
<p>Lord Byron often speaks as if he deemed himself subject to tendencies
which might terminate in insanity.&nbsp; The idea is so often mentioned
and dwelt upon in his letters, journals, and conversations, that we
cannot but ascribe it to some very peculiar experience, and not to mere
affectation.</p>
<p>But, in the history of his early childhood and youth, we see no evidence
of any original malformation of nature.&nbsp; We see only evidence of
one of those organisations, full of hope and full of peril, which adverse
influences might easily drive to insanity, but wise physiological training
and judicious moral culture might have guided to the most splendid results.&nbsp;
But of these he had neither.&nbsp; He was alternately the pet and victim
of his mother&rsquo;s tumultuous nature, and equally injured both by
her love and her anger.&nbsp; A Scotch maid of religious character gave
him early serious impressions of religion, and thus added the element
of an awakened conscience to the conflicting ones of his character.</p>
<p>Education, in the proper sense of the word, did not exist in England
in those days.&nbsp; Physiological considerations of the influence of
the body on the soul, of the power of brain and nerve over moral development,
had then not even entered the general thought of society.&nbsp; The
school and college education literally taught him nothing but the ancient
classics, of whose power in exciting and developing the animal passions
Byron often speaks.</p>
<p>The morality of the times is strikingly exemplified even in its literary
criticism.</p>
<p>For example: One of Byron&rsquo;s poems, written while a schoolboy
at Harrow, is addressed to &lsquo;My Son.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr. Moore, and
the annotator of the standard edition of Byron&rsquo;s poems, gravely
give the public their speculations on the point, whether Lord Byron
first became a father while a schoolboy at Harrow; and go into particulars
in relation to a certain infant, the claim to which lay between Lord
Byron and another schoolfellow.&nbsp; It is not the nature of the event
itself, so much as the cool, unembarrassed manner in which it is discussed,
that gives the impression of the state of public morals.&nbsp; There
is no intimation of anything unusual, or discreditable to the school,
in the event, and no apparent suspicion that it will be regarded as
a serious imputation on Lord Byron&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p>Modern physiological developments would lead any person versed in
the study of the reciprocal influence of physical and moral laws to
anticipate the most serious danger to such an organisation as Lord Byron&rsquo;s,
from a precocious development of the passions.&nbsp; Alcoholic and narcotic
stimulants, in the case of such a person, would be regarded as little
less than suicidal, and an early course of combined drinking and licentiousness
as tending directly to establish those unsound conditions which lead
towards moral insanity.&nbsp; Yet not only Lord Byron&rsquo;s testimony,
but every probability from the licence of society, goes to show that
this was exactly what did take place.</p>
<p>Neither restrained by education, nor warned by any correct physiological
knowledge, nor held in check by any public sentiment, he drifted directly
upon the fatal rock.</p>
<p>Here we give Mr. Moore full credit for all his abatements in regard
to Lord Byron&rsquo;s excesses in his early days.&nbsp; Moore makes
the point very strongly that he was not, <i>de facto</i>, even so bad
as many of his associates; and we agree with him.&nbsp; Byron&rsquo;s
physical organisation was originally as fine and sensitive as that of
the most delicate woman.&nbsp; He possessed the faculty of moral ideality
in a high degree; and he had not, in the earlier part of his life, an
attraction towards mere brutal vice.&nbsp; His physical sensitiveness
was so remarkable that he says of himself, &lsquo;A dose of salts has
the effect of a temporary inebriation, like light champagne, upon me.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Yet this exceptionally delicately-organised boy and youth was in a circle
where not to conform to the coarse drinking-customs of his day was to
incur censure and ridicule.&nbsp; That he early acquired the power of
bearing large quantities of liquor is manifested by the record in his
Journal, that, on the day when he read the severe &lsquo;Edinburgh&rsquo;
article upon his schoolboy poems, he drank three bottles of claret at
a sitting.</p>
<p>Yet Byron was so far superior to his times, that some vague impulses
to physiological prudence seem to have suggested themselves to him,
and been acted upon with great vigour.&nbsp; He never could have lived
so long as he did, under the exhaustive process of every kind of excess,
if he had not re-enforced his physical nature by an assiduous care of
his muscular system.&nbsp; He took boxing-lessons, and distinguished
himself in all athletic exercises.</p>
<p>He also had periods in which he seemed to try vaguely to retrieve
himself from dissipation, and to acquire self-mastery by what he called
temperance.</p>
<p>But, ignorant and excessive in all his movements, his very efforts
at temperance were intemperate.&nbsp; From violent excesses in eating
and drinking, he would pass to no less unnatural periods of utter abstinence.&nbsp;
Thus the very conservative power which Nature has of adapting herself
to any <i>settled</i> course was lost.&nbsp; The extreme sensitiveness
produced by long periods of utter abstinence made the succeeding debauch
more maddening and fatal.&nbsp; He was like a fine musical instrument,
whose strings were every day alternating between extreme tension and
perfect laxity.&nbsp; We have in his Journal many passages, of which
the following is a specimen:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I have dined regularly to-day, for the first time
since Sunday last; this being Sabbath too,&mdash;all the rest, tea and
dry biscuits, six per diem.&nbsp; I wish to God I had not dined, now!&nbsp;
It kills me with heaviness, stupor, and horrible dreams; and yet it
was but a pint of bucellas, and fish.&nbsp; Meat I never touch, nor
much vegetable diet.&nbsp; I wish I were in the country, to take exercise,
instead of being obliged to cool by abstinence, in lieu of it.&nbsp;
I should not so much mind a little accession of flesh: my bones can
well bear it.&nbsp; But the worst is, the Devil always came with it,
till I starved him out; and I will not be the slave of any appetite.&nbsp;
If I do err, it shall be my heart, at least, that heralds the way.&nbsp;
O my head! how it aches!&nbsp; The horrors of digestion!&nbsp; I wonder
how Bonaparte&rsquo;s dinner agrees with him.&rsquo;&mdash;Moore&rsquo;s
Life, vol. ii. p.264.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From all the contemporary history and literature of the times, therefore,
we have reason to believe that Lord Byron spoke the exact truth when
he said to Medwin,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;My own master at an age when I most required a
guide, left to the dominion of my passions when they were the strongest,
with a fortune anticipated before I came into possession of it, and
a constitution impaired by early excesses, I commenced my travels, in
1809, with a joyless indifference to the world and all that was before
me.&rsquo;&mdash;Medwin&rsquo;s Conversations, p.42.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Utter prostration of the whole physical man from intemperate excess,
the deadness to temptation which comes from utter exhaustion, was his
condition, according to himself and Moore, when he first left England,
at twenty-one years of age.</p>
<p>In considering his subsequent history, we are to take into account
that it was upon the brain and nerve-power, thus exhausted by early
excess, that the draughts of sudden and rapid literary composition began
to be made.&nbsp; There was something unnatural and unhealthy in the
rapidity, clearness, and vigour with which his various works followed
each other.&nbsp; Subsequently to the first two cantos of &lsquo;Childe
Harold,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Bride of Abydos,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Corsair,&rsquo;
&lsquo;The Giaour,&rsquo; &lsquo;Lara,&rsquo; &lsquo;Parisina,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;The Siege of Corinth,&rsquo; all followed close upon each
other, in a space of less than three years, and those the three most
critical years of his life.&nbsp; &lsquo;The Bride of Abydos&rsquo;
came out in the autumn of 1813, and was written in a week; and &lsquo;The
Corsair&rsquo; was composed in thirteen days.&nbsp; A few months more
than a year before his marriage, and the brief space of his married
life, was the period in which all this literary labour was performed,
while yet he was running the wild career of intrigue and fashionable
folly.&nbsp; He speaks of &lsquo;Lara&rsquo; as being tossed off in
the intervals between masquerades and balls, etc.&nbsp; It is with the
physical results of such unnatural efforts that we have now chiefly
to do.&nbsp; Every physiologist would say that the demands of such poems
on a healthy brain, in that given space, must have been exhausting;
but when we consider that they were cheques drawn on a bank broken by
early extravagance, and that the subject was prodigally spending vital
forces in every other direction at the same time, one can scarcely estimate
the physiological madness of such a course as Lord Byron&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It is evident from his Journal, and Moore&rsquo;s account, that any
amount of physical force which was for the time restored by his first
foreign travel was recklessly spent in this period, when he threw himself
with a mad recklessness into London society in the time just preceding
his marriage.&nbsp; The revelations made in Moore&rsquo;s Memoir of
this period are sad enough: those to Medwin are so appalling as to the
state of contemporary society in England, as to require, at least, the
benefit of the doubt for which Lord Byron&rsquo;s habitual carelessness
of truth gave scope.&nbsp; His adventures with ladies of the highest
rank in England are there paraded with a freedom of detail that respect
for womanhood must lead every woman to question.&nbsp; The only thing
that is unquestionable is, that Lord Byron made these assertions to
Medwin, not as remorseful confessions, but as relations of his <i>bonnes
fortunes</i>, and that Medwin published them in the very face of the
society to which they related.</p>
<p>When Lord Byron says, &lsquo;I have seen a great deal of Italian
society, and swum in a gondola; but nothing could equal the profligacy
of high life in England . . .&nbsp; when I knew it,&rsquo; he makes
certainly strong assertions, if we remember what Mr. Moore reveals of
the harem kept in Venice.</p>
<p>But when Lord Byron intimates that three married women in his own
rank in life, who had once held illicit relations with him, made wedding-visits
to his wife at one time, we must hope that he drew on his active imagination,
as he often did, in his statements in regard to women.</p>
<p>When he relates at large his amour with Lord Melbourne&rsquo;s wife,
and represents her as pursuing him with an insane passion, to which
he with difficulty responded; and when he says that she tracked a rival
lady to his lodgings, and came into them herself, disguised as a carman&mdash;one
<i>hopes</i> that he exaggerates.&nbsp; And what are we to make of passages
like this?&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;There was a lady at that time, double my own age,
the mother of several children who were perfect angels, with whom I
formed a liaison that continued without interruption for eight months.&nbsp;
She told me she was never in love till she was thirty, and I thought
myself so with her when she was forty.&nbsp; I never felt a stronger
passion, which she returned with equal ardour . . . . . . .</p>
<p>&lsquo;Strange as it may seem, she gained, as all women do, an influence
over me so strong that I had great difficulty in breaking with her.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, these statements, though probably exaggerated, are,
for substance, borne out in the history of the times.&nbsp; With every
possible abatement for exaggeration in these statements, there remains
still undoubted evidence from other sources that Lord Byron exercised
a most peculiar and fatal power over the moral sense of the women with
whom he was brought in relation; and that love for him, in many women,
became a sort of insanity, depriving them of the just use of their faculties.&nbsp;
All this makes his fatal history both possible and probable.</p>
<p>Even the article in &lsquo;Blackwood,&rsquo; written in 1825 for
the express purpose of vindicating his character, admits that his name
had been coupled with those of three, four, or more women of rank, whom
it speaks of as &lsquo;licentious, unprincipled, characterless women.&rsquo;</p>
<p>That such a course, in connection with alternate extremes of excess
and abstinence in eating and drinking, and the immense draughts on the
brain-power of rapid and brilliant composition, should have ended in
that abnormal state in which cravings for unnatural vice give indications
of approaching brain-disease, seems only too probable.</p>
<p>This symptom of exhausted vitality becomes often a frequent type
in periods of very corrupt society.&nbsp; The dregs of the old Greek
and Roman civilisation were foul with it; and the apostle speaks of
the turning of the use of the natural into that which is against nature,
as the last step in abandonment.</p>
<p>The very literature of such periods marks their want of physical
and moral soundness.&nbsp; Having lost all sense of what is simple and
natural and pure, the mind delights to dwell on horrible ideas, which
give a shuddering sense of guilt and crime.&nbsp; All the writings of
this fatal period of Lord Byron&rsquo;s life are more or less intense
histories of unrepentant guilt and remorse or of unnatural crime.&nbsp;
A recent writer in &lsquo;Temple Bar&rsquo; brings to light the fact,
that &lsquo;The Bride of Abydos,&rsquo; the first of the brilliant and
rapid series of poems which began in the period immediately preceding
his marriage, was, in its first composition, an intense story of love
between a brother and sister in a Turkish harem; that Lord Byron declared,
in a letter to Galt, that it was drawn from <i>real life</i>; that,
in compliance with the prejudices of the age, he altered the relationship
to that of cousins before publication.</p>
<p>This same writer goes on to show, by a series of extracts from Lord
Byron&rsquo;s published letters and journals, that his mind about this
time was in a fearfully unnatural state, and suffering singular and
inexplicable agonies of remorse; that, though he was accustomed fearlessly
to confide to his friends immoralities which would be looked upon as
damning, there was now a secret to which he could not help alluding
in his letters, but which he told Moore he could not tell now, but &lsquo;some
day or other when we are <i>veterans</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; He speaks of
his heart as eating itself out; of a mysterious <i>person</i>, whom
he says, &lsquo;God knows I love too well, and the Devil probably too.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He wrote a song, and sent it to Moore, addressed to a partner in some
awful guilt, whose very name he dares not mention, because</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;There is grief in the sound,
there is guilt in the fame.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He speaks of struggles of remorse, of efforts at repentance, and
returns to guilt, with a sort of horror very different from the well-pleased
air with which he relates to Medwin his common intrigues and adulteries.&nbsp;
He speaks of himself generally as oppressed by a frightful, unnatural
gloom and horror, and, when occasionally happy, &lsquo;not in a way
that <i>can</i> or <i>ought</i> to last.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Giaour,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Corsair,&rsquo; &lsquo;Lara,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Parisina,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Siege of Corinth,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Manfred,&rsquo;
all written or conceived about this period of his life, give one picture
of a desperate, despairing, unrepentant soul, whom suffering maddens,
but cannot reclaim.</p>
<p>In all these he paints only the one woman, of concentrated, unconsidering
passion, ready to sacrifice heaven and defy hell for a guilty man, beloved
in spite of religion or reason.&nbsp; In this unnatural literature,
the stimulus of crime is represented as intensifying love.&nbsp; Medora,
Gulnare, the Page in &lsquo;Lara,&rsquo; Parisina, and the lost sister
of Manfred, love the more intensely because the object of the love is
a criminal, out-lawed by God and man.&nbsp; The next step beyond this
is&mdash;<i>madness</i>.</p>
<p>The work of Dr. Forbes Winslow on &lsquo;Obscure Diseases of the
Brain and Nerves&rsquo; <a name="citation258"></a><a href="#footnote258">{258}</a>
contains a passage so very descriptive of the case of Lord Byron, that
it might seem to have been written for it.&nbsp; The sixth chapter of
his work, on &lsquo;Anomalous and Masked Affections of the Mind,&rsquo;
contains, in our view, the only clue that can unravel the sad tragedy
of Byron&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; He says, p.87,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;These forms of unrecognised mental disorder are
not always accompanied by any well-marked disturbance of the bodily
health requiring medical attention, or any obvious departure from a
normal state of thought and conduct such as to justify legal interference;
neither do these affections always incapacitate the party from engaging
in the ordinary business of life . . . .&nbsp; The change may have progressed
insidiously and stealthily, having slowly and almost imperceptibly induced
important molecular modifications in the delicate vesicular neurine
of the brain, ultimately resulting in some aberration of the ideas,
alteration of the affections, or perversion of the propensities or instincts.
. . .</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mental disorder of a dangerous character has been known for
years to be stealthily advancing, without exciting the slightest notion
of its presence, until some sad and terrible catastrophe, homicide,
or suicide, has painfully awakened attention to its existence.&nbsp;
Persons suffering from latent insanity often affect singularity of dress,
gait, conversation, and phraseology.&nbsp; The most trifling circumstances
stimulate their excitability.&nbsp; They are martyrs to ungovernable
paroxysms of passion, are inflamed to a state of demoniacal fury by
the most insignificant of causes, and occasionally lose all sense of
delicacy of feeling, sentiment, refinement of manners and conversation.&nbsp;
Such manifestations of undetected mental disorder may be seen associated
with intellectual and moral qualities of the highest order.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another place, Dr. Winslow again adverts to this latter symptom,
which was strikingly marked in the case of Lord Byron:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;All delicacy and decency of thought are occasionally
banished from the mind, so effectually does the principle of thought
in these attacks succumb to the animal instincts and passions . . .
.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Such cases will commonly be found associated with organic
predisposition to insanity or cerebral disease . . . .&nbsp; Modifications
of the malady are seen allied with genius.&nbsp; The biographies of
Cowper, Burns, Byron, Johnson, Pope, and Haydon establish that the most
exalted intellectual conditions do not escape unscathed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In early childhood, this form of mental disturbance may, in
many cases, be detected.&nbsp; To its existence is often to be traced
the motiveless crimes of the young.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No one can compare this passage of Dr. Forbes Winslow with the incidents
we have already cited as occurring in that fatal period before the separation
of Lord and Lady Byron, and not feel that the hapless young wife was
indeed struggling with those inflexible natural laws, which, at some
stages of retribution, involve in their awful sweep the guilty with
the innocent.&nbsp; She longed to save; but he was gone past redemption.&nbsp;
Alcoholic stimulants and licentious excesses, without doubt, had produced
those unseen changes in the brain, of which Dr. Forbes Winslow speaks;
and the results were terrible in proportion to the peculiar fineness
and delicacy of the organism deranged.</p>
<p>Alas! the history of Lady Byron is the history of too many women
in every rank of life who are called, in agonies of perplexity and fear,
to watch that gradual process by which physical excesses change the
organism of the brain, till slow, creeping, moral insanity comes on.&nbsp;
The woman who is the helpless victim of cruelties which only unnatural
states of the brain could invent, who is heart-sick to-day and dreads
to-morrow,&mdash;looks in hopeless horror on the fatal process by which
a lover and a protector changes under her eyes, from day to day, to
a brute and a fiend.</p>
<p>Lady Byron&rsquo;s married life&mdash;alas! it is lived over in many
a cottage and tenement-house, with no understanding on either side of
the cause of the woeful misery.</p>
<p>Dr. Winslow truly says, &lsquo;The science of these brain-affections
is yet in its infancy in England.&rsquo;&nbsp; At that time, it had
not even begun to be.&nbsp; Madness was a fixed point; and the inquiries
into it had no nicety.&nbsp; Its treatment, if established, had no redeeming
power.&nbsp; Insanity simply locked a man up as a dangerous being; and
the very suggestion of it, therefore, was resented as an injury.</p>
<p>A most peculiar and affecting feature of that form of brain disease
which hurries its victim, as by an overpowering mania, into crime, is,
that often the moral faculties and the affections remain to a degree
unimpaired, and protest with all their strength against the outrage.&nbsp;
Hence come conflicts and agonies of remorse proportioned to the strength
of the moral nature.&nbsp; Byron, more than any other one writer, may
be called the poet of remorse.&nbsp; His passionate pictures of this
feeling seem to give new power to the English language:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;There is a war, a chaos of the mind,<br />
When all its elements convulsed&mdash;combined,<br />
Lie dark and jarring with perturb&egrave;d force,<br />
And gnashing with impenitent remorse,<br />
That juggling fiend, who never spake before,<br />
But cries, &ldquo;I warned thee!&rdquo; when the deed is o&rsquo;er.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was this remorse that formed the only redeeming feature of the
case.&nbsp; Its eloquence, its agonies, won from all hearts the interest
that we give to a powerful nature in a state of danger and ruin; and
it may be hoped that this feeling, which tempers the stern justice of
human judgments, may prove only a faint image of the wider charity of
Him whose thoughts are as far above ours as the heaven is above the
earth.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VII.&nbsp; HOW COULD SHE LOVE HIM?</h3>
<p>It has seemed, to some, wholly inconsistent, that Lady Byron, if
this story were true, could retain any kindly feeling for Lord Byron,
or any tenderness for his memory; that the profession implied a certain
hypocrisy: but, in this sad review, we may see how the woman who once
had loved him, might, in spite of every wrong he had heaped upon her,
still have looked on this awful wreck and ruin chiefly with pity.&nbsp;
While she stood afar, and refused to justify or join in the polluted
idolatry which defended his vices, there is evidence in her writings
that her mind often went back mournfully, as a mother&rsquo;s would,
to the early days when he might have been saved.</p>
<p>One of her letters in Robinson&rsquo;s Memoirs, in regard to his
religious opinions, shows with what intense earnestness she dwelt upon
the unhappy influences of his childhood and youth, and those early theologies
which led him to regard himself as one of the reprobate.&nbsp; She says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Not merely from casual expressions, but from the
whole tenor of Lord Byron&rsquo;s feelings, I could not but conclude
that he was a believer in the inspiration of the Bible, and had the
gloomiest Calvinistic tenets.&nbsp; To that unhappy view of the relation
of the creature to the Creator I have always ascribed the misery of
his life.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is enough for me to know that he who thinks his transgression
beyond forgiveness . . . has righteousness beyond that of the self-satisfied
sinner.&nbsp; It is impossible for me to doubt, that, could he once
have been assured of pardon, his living faith in moral duty, and love
of virtue (&ldquo;I love the virtues that I cannot claim&rdquo;), would
have conquered every temptation.&nbsp; Judge, then, how I must hate
the creed that made him see God as an Avenger, and not as a Father!&nbsp;
My own impressions were just the reverse, but could have but little
weight; and it was in vain to seek to turn his thoughts from that fixed
idea with which he connected his personal peculiarity as a stamp.&nbsp;
Instead of being made happier by any apparent good, he felt convinced
that every blessing would be turned into a curse to him . . . &ldquo;The
worst of it is, I do believe,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; I, like all connected
with him, was broken against the rock of predestination.&nbsp; I may
be pardoned for my frequent reference to the sentiment (expressed by
him), that I was only sent to show him the happiness he was forbidden
to enjoy.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this letter we have the heart, not of the wife, but of the mother,&mdash;the
love that searches everywhere for extenuations of the guilt it is forced
to confess.</p>
<p>That Lady Byron was not alone in ascribing such results to the doctrines
of Calvinism, in certain cases, appears from the language of the Thirty-nine
Articles, which says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;As the godly consideration of predestination,
and our election in Christ, is full of sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable
comfort to godly persons, and such as feel in themselves the workings
of the spirit of Christ; . . .&nbsp; so, for curious and carnal persons,
lacking the spirit of Christ, to have continually before their eyes
the sentence of God&rsquo;s predestination, is a most dangerous downfall,
whereby the Devil doth thrust them either into desperation, or into
recklessness of most unclean living,&mdash;no less perilous than desperation.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lord Byron&rsquo;s life is an exact commentary on these words, which
passed under the revision of Calvin himself.</p>
<p>The whole tone of this letter shows not only that Lady Byron never
lost her deep interest in her husband, but that it was by this experience
that all her religious ideas were modified.&nbsp; There is another of
these letters in which she thus speaks of her husband&rsquo;s writings
and character:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The author of the article on &ldquo;Goethe&rdquo;
appears to me to have the mind which could dispel the illusion about
another poet, without depreciating his claims . . . to the truest inspiration.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Who has sought to distinguish between the holy and the unholy
in that spirit? to prove, by the very degradation of the one, how high
the other was.&nbsp; A character is never done justice to by extenuating
its faults: so I do not agree to nisi bonum.&nbsp; It is kinder to read
the blotted page.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These letters show that Lady Byron&rsquo;s idea was that, even were
the whole mournful truth about Lord Byron fully told, there was still
a foundation left for pity and mercy.&nbsp; She seems to have remembered,
that if his sins were peculiar, so also were his temptations; and to
have schooled herself for years to gather up, and set in order in her
memory, all that yet remained precious in this great ruin.&nbsp; Probably
no English writer that ever has made the attempt could have done this
more perfectly.&nbsp; Though Lady Byron was not a poet <i>par excellence</i>,
yet she belonged to an order of souls fully equal to Lord Byron.&nbsp;
Hers was more the analytical mind of the philosopher than the creative
mind of the poet; and it was, for that reason, the one mind in our day
capable of estimating him fully both with justice and mercy.&nbsp; No
person in England had a more intense sensibility to genius, in its loftier
acceptation, than Lady Byron; and none more completely sympathised with
what was pure and exalted in her husband&rsquo;s writings.</p>
<p>There is this peculiarity in Lord Byron, that the pure and the impure
in his poetry often run side by side without mixing,&mdash;as one may
see at Geneva the muddy stream of the Arve and the blue waters of the
Rhone flowing together unmingled.&nbsp; What, for example, can be nobler,
and in a higher and tenderer moral strain than his lines on the dying
gladiator, in &lsquo;Childe Harold&rsquo;?&nbsp; What is more like the
vigour of the old Hebrew Scriptures than his thunderstorm in the Alps?&nbsp;
What can more perfectly express moral ideality of the highest kind than
the exquisite descriptions of Aurora Raby,&mdash;pure and high in thought
and language, occurring, as they do, in a work full of the most utter
vileness?</p>
<p>Lady Byron&rsquo;s hopes for her husband fastened themselves on all
the noble fragments yet remaining in that shattered temple of his mind
which lay blackened and thunder-riven; and she looked forward to a sphere
beyond this earth, where infinite mercy should bring all again to symmetry
and order.&nbsp; If the strict theologian must regret this as an undue
latitude of charity, let it at least be remembered that it was a charity
which sprang from a Christian virtue, and which she extended to every
human being, however lost, however low.&nbsp; In her view, the mercy
which took <i>him</i> was mercy that could restore all.</p>
<p>In my recollections of the interview with Lady Byron, when this whole
history was presented, I can remember that it was with a softened and
saddened feeling that I contemplated the story, as one looks on some
awful, inexplicable ruin.</p>
<p>The last letter which I addressed to Lady Byron upon this subject
will show that such was the impression of the whole interview.&nbsp;
It was in reply to the one written on the death of my son:&mdash;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Jan.
30, 1858.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;MY DEAR FRIEND,&mdash;I did long to hear from
you at a time when few knew how to speak, because I knew that you had
known everything that sorrow can teach,&mdash;you, whose whole life
has been a crucifixion, a long ordeal.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I believe that the Lamb, who stands for ever &ldquo;in
the midst of the throne, as it had been slain,&rdquo; has everywhere
His followers,&mdash;those who seem sent into the world, as He was,
to suffer for the redemption of others; and, like Him, they must look
to the joy set before them,&mdash;of redeeming others.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I often think that God called you to this beautiful and terrible
ministry when He suffered you to link your destiny with one so strangely
gifted and so fearfully tempted.&nbsp; Perhaps the reward that is to
meet you when you enter within the veil where you must so soon pass
will be to see that spirit, once chained and defiled, set free and purified;
and to know that to you it has been given, by your life of love and
faith, to accomplish this glorious change.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think increasingly on the subject on which you conversed
with me once,&mdash;the future state of retribution.&nbsp; It is evident
to me that the spirit of Christianity has produced in the human spirit
a tenderness of love which wholly revolts from the old doctrine on this
subject; and I observe, that, the more Christ-like anyone becomes, the
more difficult it seems for them to accept it as hitherto presented.&nbsp;
And yet, on the contrary, it was Christ who said, &ldquo;Fear Him that
is able to destroy both soul and body in hell;&rdquo; and the most appalling
language is that of Christ himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certain ideas, once prevalent, certainly must be thrown off.&nbsp;
An endless infliction for past sins was once the doctrine: that we now
generally reject.&nbsp; The doctrine now generally taught is, that an
eternal persistence in evil necessitates everlasting suffering, since
evil induces misery by the eternal nature of things; and this, I fear,
is inferable from the analogies of Nature, and confirmed by the whole
implication of the Bible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What attention have you given to this subject? and is there
any fair way of disposing of the current of assertion, and the still
deeper under-current of implication, on this subject, without admitting
one which loosens all faith in revelation, and throws us on pure naturalism?&nbsp;
But of one thing I always feel sure: probation does not end with this
present life; and the number of the saved may therefore be infinitely
greater than the world&rsquo;s history leads us to suppose.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think the Bible implies a great crisis, a struggle, an agony,
in which God and Christ and all the good are engaged in redeeming from
sin; and we are not to suppose that the little portion that is done
for souls as they pass between the two doors of birth and death is all.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Bible is certainly silent there.&nbsp; The primitive Church
believed in the mercies of an intermediate state; and it was only the
abuse of it by Romanism that drove the Church into its present position,
which, I think, is wholly indefensible, and wholly irreconcilable with
the spirit of Christ.&nbsp; For if it were the case, that probation
in all cases begins and ends here, God&rsquo;s example would surely
be one that could not be followed, and He would seem to be far less
persevering than even human beings in efforts to save.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing is plainer than that it would be wrong to give up
any mind to eternal sin till every possible thing had been done for
its recovery; and that is so clearly not the case here, that I can see
that, with thoughtful minds, this belief would cut the very roots of
religious faith in God: for there is a difference between facts that
we do not understand, and facts which we do understand, and perceive
to be wholly irreconcilable with a certain character professed by God.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If God says He is love, and certain ways of explaining Scripture
make Him less loving and patient than man, then we make Scripture contradict
itself.&nbsp; Now, as no passage of Scripture limits probation to this
life, and as one passage in Peter certainly unequivocally asserts that
Christ preached to the spirits in prison while His body lay in the grave,
I am clear upon this point.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But it is also clear, that if there be those who persist in
refusing God&rsquo;s love, who choose to dash themselves for ever against
the inflexible laws of the universe, such souls must for ever suffer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There may be souls who hate purity because it reveals their
vileness; who refuse God&rsquo;s love, and prefer eternal conflict with
it.&nbsp; For such there can be no peace.&nbsp; Even in this life, we
see those whom the purest self-devoting love only inflames to madness;
and we have only to suppose an eternal persistence in this to suppose
eternal misery.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But on this subject we can only leave all reverently in the
hands of that Being whose almighty power is &ldquo;declared chiefly
in showing mercy.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII.&nbsp; CONCLUSION.</h3>
<p>In leaving this subject, I have an appeal to make to the men, and
more especially to the women, who have been my readers.</p>
<p>In justice to Lady Byron, it must be remembered that this publication
of her story is not her act, but mine.&nbsp; I trust you have already
conceded, that, in so severe and peculiar a trial, she had a right to
be understood fully by her immediate circle of friends, and to seek
of them counsel in view of the moral questions to which such very exceptional
circumstances must have given rise.&nbsp; Her communication to me was
not an address to the public: it was a statement of the case for advice.&nbsp;
True, by leaving the whole, unguarded by pledge or promise, it left
discretionary power with me to use it if needful.</p>
<p>You, my sisters, are to judge whether the accusation laid against
Lady Byron by the &lsquo;Blackwood,&rsquo; in 1869, was not of so barbarous
a nature as to justify my producing the truth I held in my hands in
reply.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; claimed a right to re-open the subject
because it was <i>not</i> a private but a public matter.&nbsp; It claimed
that Lord Byron&rsquo;s unfortunate marriage might have changed not
only his own destiny, but that of all England.&nbsp; It suggested, that,
but for this, instead of wearing out his life in vice, and corrupting
society by impure poetry, he might, at this day, have been leading the
counsels of the State, and helping the onward movements of the world.&nbsp;
Then it directly charged Lady Byron with meanly forsaking her husband
in a time of worldly misfortune; with fabricating a destructive accusation
of crime against him, and confirming this accusation by years of persistent
silence more guilty than open assertion.</p>
<p>It has been alleged, that, even admitting that Lady Byron&rsquo;s
story were true, it never ought to have been told.&nbsp; Is it true,
then, that a woman has not the same right to individual justice that
a man has?&nbsp; If the cases were reversed, would it have been thought
just that Lord Byron should go down in history loaded with accusations
of crime because he could be only vindicated by exposing the crime of
his wife?</p>
<p>It has been said that the crime charged on Lady Byron was comparatively
unimportant, and the one against Lord Byron was deadly.</p>
<p>But the &lsquo;Blackwood,&rsquo; in opening the controversy, called
Lady Byron by the name of an unnatural female criminal, whose singular
atrocities alone entitle her to infamous notoriety; and the crime charged
upon her was sufficient to warrant the comparison.</p>
<p>Both crimes are foul, unnatural, horrible; and there is no middle
ground between the admission of the one or the other.</p>
<p>You must either conclude that a woman, all whose other works, words,
and deeds were generous, just, and gentle, committed this one monstrous
exceptional crime, without a motive, and against all the analogies of
her character, and all the analogies of her treatment of others; or
you must suppose that a man known by all testimony to have been boundlessly
licentious, who took the very course which, by every physiological law,
would have led to unnatural results, did, at last, commit an unnatural
crime.</p>
<p>The question, whether I did right, when Lady Byron was thus held
up as an abandoned criminal by the &lsquo;Blackwood,&rsquo; to interpose
my knowledge of the real truth in her defence, is a serious one; but
it is one for which I must account to God alone, and in which, without
any contempt of the opinions of my fellow-creatures, I must say, that
it is a small thing to be judged of man&rsquo;s judgment.</p>
<p>I had in the case a responsibility very different from that of many
others.&nbsp; I had been consulted in relation to the publication of
this story by Lady Byron, at a time when she had it in her power to
have exhibited it with all its proofs, and commanded an instant conviction.&nbsp;
I have reason to think that my advice had some weight in suppressing
that disclosure.&nbsp; I gave that advice under the impression that
the Byron controversy was a thing for ever passed, and never likely
to return.</p>
<p>It had never occurred to me, that, nine years after Lady Byron&rsquo;s
death, a standard English periodical would declare itself free to re-open
this controversy, when all the generation who were her witnesses had
passed from earth; and that it would re-open it in the most savage form
of accusation, and with the indorsement and commendation of a book of
the vilest slanders, edited by Lord Byron&rsquo;s mistress.</p>
<p>Let the reader mark the retributions of justice.&nbsp; The accusations
of the &lsquo;Blackwood,&rsquo; in 1869, were simply an intensified
form of those first concocted by Lord Byron in his &lsquo;Clytemnestra&rsquo;
poem of 1816.&nbsp; He forged that weapon, and bequeathed it to his
party.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; took it up, gave it a sharper
edge, and drove it to the heart of Lady Byron&rsquo;s fame.&nbsp; The
result has been the disclosure of this history.&nbsp; It is, then, Lord
Byron himself, who, by his network of wiles, his ceaseless persecutions
of his wife, his efforts to extend his partisanship beyond the grave,
has brought on this tumultuous exposure.&nbsp; He, and he alone, is
the cause of this revelation.</p>
<p>And now I have one word to say to those in England who, with all
the facts and documents in their hands which could at once have cleared
Lady Byron&rsquo;s fame, allowed the barbarous assault of the &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo;
to go over the civilised world without a reply.&nbsp; I speak to those
who, knowing that I am speaking the truth, stand silent; to those who
have now the ability to produce the facts and documents by which this
cause might be instantly settled, and who do not produce them.</p>
<p>I do not judge them; but I remind them that a day is coming when
they and I must stand side by side at the great judgment-seat,&mdash;I
to give an account for my speaking, they for their silence.</p>
<p>In that day, all earthly considerations will have vanished like morning
mists, and truth or falsehood, justice or injustice, will be the only
realities.</p>
<p>In that day, God, who will judge the secrets of all men, will judge
between this man and this woman.&nbsp; Then, if never before, the full
truth shall be told both of the depraved and dissolute man who made
it his life&rsquo;s object to defame the innocent, and the silent, the
self-denying woman who made it her life&rsquo;s object to give space
for repentance to the guilty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>PART III.&nbsp; MISCELLANEOUS DOCUMENTS.</h2>
<h3>THE TRUE STORY OF LADY BYRON&rsquo;S LIFE,<br />
AS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN &lsquo;THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>The reading world of America has lately been presented with a book
which is said to sell rapidly, and which appears to meet with universal
favour.</p>
<p>The subject of the book may be thus briefly stated: The mistress
of Lord Byron comes before the world for the sake of vindicating his
fame from slanders and aspersions cast on him by his wife.&nbsp; The
story of the mistress <i>versus</i> wife may be summed up as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Lord Byron, the hero of the story, is represented as a human being
endowed with every natural charm, gift, and grace, who, by the one false
step of an unsuitable marriage, wrecked his whole life.&nbsp; A narrow-minded,
cold-hearted precisian, without sufficient intellect to comprehend his
genius, or heart to feel for his temptations, formed with him one of
those mere worldly marriages common in high life; and, finding that
she could not reduce him to the mathematical proprieties and conventional
rules of her own mode of life, suddenly, and without warning, abandoned
him in the most cruel and inexplicable manner.</p>
<p>It is alleged that she parted from him in apparent affection and
good-humour, wrote him a playful, confiding letter upon the way, but,
after reaching her father&rsquo;s house, suddenly, and without explanation,
announced to him that she would never see him again; that this sudden
abandonment drew down upon him a perfect storm of scandalous stories,
which his wife never contradicted; that she never in any way or shape
stated what the exact reasons for her departure had been, and thus silently
gave scope to all the malice of thousands of enemies.&nbsp; The sensitive
victim was actually driven from England, his home broken up, and he
doomed to be a lonely wanderer on foreign shores.</p>
<p>In Italy, under bluer skies, and among a gentler people, with more
tolerant modes of judgment, the authoress intimates that he found peace
and consolation.&nbsp; A lovely young Italian countess falls in love
with him, and, breaking her family ties for his sake, devotes herself
to him; and, in blissful retirement with her, he finds at last that
domestic life for which he was so fitted.</p>
<p>Soothed, calmed, and refreshed, he writes &lsquo;Don Juan,&rsquo;
which the world is at this late hour informed was a poem with a high
moral purpose, designed to be a practical illustration of the doctrine
of total depravity among young gentlemen in high life.</p>
<p>Under the elevating influence of love, he rises at last to higher
realms of moral excellence, and resolves to devote the rest of his life
to some noble and heroic purpose; becomes the saviour of Greece; and
dies untimely, leaving a nation to mourn his loss.</p>
<p>The authoress dwells with a peculiar bitterness on Lady Byron&rsquo;s
entire <i>silence</i> during all these years, as the most aggravated
form of persecution and injury.&nbsp; She informs the world that Lord
Byron wrote his Autobiography with the purpose of giving a fair statement
of the exact truth in the whole matter; and that Lady Byron bought up
the manuscript of the publisher, and insisted on its being destroyed,
unread; thus inflexibly depriving her husband of his last chance of
a hearing before the tribunal of the public.</p>
<p>As a result of this silent persistent cruelty on the part of a cold,
correct, narrow-minded woman, the character of Lord Byron has been misunderstood,
and his name transmitted to after-ages clouded with aspersions and accusations
which it is the object of this book to remove.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Such is the story of Lord Byron&rsquo;s mistress,&mdash;a story which
is going the length of this American continent, and rousing up new sympathy
with the poet, and doing its best to bring the youth of America once
more under the power of that brilliant, seductive genius, from which
it was hoped they had escaped.&nbsp; Already we are seeing it revamped
in magazine-articles, which take up the slanders of the paramour and
enlarge on them, and wax eloquent in denunciation of the marble-hearted
insensible wife.</p>
<p>All this while, it does not appear to occur to the thousands of unreflecting
readers that they are listening merely to the story of Lord Byron&rsquo;s
mistress, and of Lord Byron; and that, even by their own showing, their
heaviest accusation against Lady Byron is that <i>she has not spoken
at all</i>.&nbsp; Her story has never been told.</p>
<p>For many years after the rupture between Lord Byron and his wife,
that poet&rsquo;s personality, fate, and happiness had an interest for
the whole civilized world, which, we will venture to say, was unparalleled.&nbsp;
It is within the writer&rsquo;s recollection, how, in the obscure mountain-town
where she spent her early days, Lord Byron&rsquo;s separation from his
wife was, for a season, the all-engrossing topic.</p>
<p>She remembers hearing her father recount at the breakfast-table the
facts as they were given in the public papers, together with his own
suppositions and theories of the causes.</p>
<p>Lord Byron&rsquo;s &lsquo;Fare thee well,&rsquo; addressed to Lady
Byron, was set to music, and sung with tears by young school-girls,
even in this distant America.</p>
<p>Madame de Sta&euml;l said of this appeal, that she was sure it would
have drawn her at once to his heart and his arms; <i>she</i> could have
forgiven everything: and so said all the young ladies all over the world,
not only in England but in France and Germany, wherever Byron&rsquo;s
poetry appeared in translation.</p>
<p>Lady Byron&rsquo;s obdurate cold-heartedness in refusing even to
listen to his prayers, or to have any intercourse with him which might
lead to reconciliation, was the one point conceded on all sides.</p>
<p>The stricter moralists defended her; but gentler hearts throughout
all the world regarded her as a marble-hearted monster of correctness
and morality, a personification of the law unmitigated by the gospel.</p>
<p>Literature in its highest walks busied itself with Lady Byron.&nbsp;
Hogg, in the character of the Ettrick Shepherd, devotes several eloquent
passages to expatiating on the conjugal fidelity of a poor Highland
shepherd&rsquo;s wife, who, by patience and prayer and forgiveness,
succeeds in reclaiming her drunken husband, and making a good man of
him; and then points his moral by contrasting with this touching picture
the cold-hearted pharisaical correctness of Lady Byron.</p>
<p>Moore, in his &lsquo;Life of Lord Byron,&rsquo; when beginning the
recital of the series of disgraceful amours which formed the staple
of his life in Venice, has this passage:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Highly censurable in point of morality and decorum as was
his course of life while under the roof of Madame ----, it was (with
pain I am forced to confess) venial in comparison with the strange,
headlong career of licence to which, when weaned from that connection,
he so unrestrainedly, and, it may be added, defyingly abandoned himself.&nbsp;
Of the state of his mind on leaving England, I have already endeavoured
to convey some idea; and among the feelings that went to make up that
self-centred spirit of resistance which he then opposed to his fate
was an indignant scorn for his own countrymen for the wrongs he thought
they had done him.&nbsp; For a time, <i>the kindly sentiments which
he still harboured toward Lady Byron, and a sort of vague hope, perhaps,
that all would yet come right again</i>, kept his mind in a mood somewhat
more softened and docile, as well as sufficiently under the influence
of English opinions to prevent his breaking out into open rebellion
against it, as he unluckily did afterward.</p>
<p><i>&lsquo;By the failure of the attempted mediation with Lady Byron</i>,
his last link with home was severed: while, notwithstanding the quiet
and unobtrusive life which he led at Geneva, there was as yet, he found,
no cessation of the slanderous warfare against his character; the same
busy and misrepresenting spirit which had tracked his every step at
home, having, with no less malicious watchfulness, dogged him into exile.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We should like to know what the misrepresentations and slanders must
have been, when this sort of thing is admitted in Mr. Moore&rsquo;s
<i>justification</i>.&nbsp; It seems to us rather wonderful how anybody,
unless it were a person like the Countess Guiccioli, could misrepresent
a life such as even Byron&rsquo;s friend admits he was leading.</p>
<p>During all these years, when he was setting at defiance every principle
of morality and decorum, the interest of the female mind all over Europe
in the conversion of this brilliant prodigal son was unceasing, and
reflects the greatest credit upon the faith of the sex.</p>
<p>Madame de Sta&euml;l commenced the first effort at evangelization
immediately after he left England, and found her catechumen in a most
edifying state of humility.&nbsp; He was, metaphorically, on his knees
in penitence, and confessed himself a miserable sinner in the loveliest
manner possible.&nbsp; Such sweetness and humility took all hearts.&nbsp;
His conversations with Madame de Sta&euml;l were printed, and circulated
all over the world; making it to appear that only the inflexibility
of Lady Byron stood in the way of his entire conversion.</p>
<p>Lady Blessington, among many others, took him in hand five or six
years afterwards, and was greatly delighted with his docility, and edified
by his frank and free confessions of his miserable offences.&nbsp; Nothing
now seemed wanting to bring the wanderer home to the fold but a kind
word from Lady Byron.&nbsp; But, when the fair countess offered to mediate,
the poet only shook his head in tragic despair; &lsquo;he had so many
times tried in vain; Lady Byron&rsquo;s course had been from the first
that of obdurate silence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Any one who would wish to see a specimen of the skill of the honourable
poet in mystification will do well to read a letter to Lady Byron, which
Lord Byron, on parting from Lady Blessington, enclosed for her to read
just before he went to Greece.&nbsp; He says,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The letter which I enclose <i>I was prevented from sending
by my despair of its doing any good</i>.&nbsp; I was perfectly sincere
when I wrote it, and am so still.&nbsp; But it is difficult for me to
withstand the thousand provocations on that subject which both friends
and foes have for seven years been throwing in the way of a man whose
feelings were once quick, and whose temper was never patient.&rsquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&lsquo;TO LADY BYRON, CARE OF THE HON. MRS. LEIGH, LONDON.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;PISA,
<i>Nov</i>. 17, 1821.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have to acknowledge the receipt of &ldquo;Ada&rsquo;s hair,&rdquo;
which is very soft and pretty, and nearly as dark already as mine was
at twelve years old, if I may judge from what I recollect of some in
Augusta&rsquo;s possession, taken at that age.&nbsp; But it don&rsquo;t
curl&mdash;perhaps from its being let grow.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I also thank you for the inscription of the date and name;
and I will tell you why: I believe that they are the only two or three
words of your handwriting in my possession.&nbsp; For your letters I
returned; and except the two words, or rather the one word, &ldquo;Household,&rdquo;
written twice in an old account book, I have no other.&nbsp; I burnt
your last note, for two reasons: firstly, it was written in a style
not very agreeable; and, secondly, I wished to take your word without
documents, which are the worldly resources of suspicious people.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose that this note will reach you somewhere about Ada&rsquo;s
birthday&mdash;the 10th of December, I believe.&nbsp; She will then
be six: so that, in about twelve more, I shall have some chance of meeting
her; perhaps sooner, if I am obliged to go to England by business or
otherwise.&nbsp; Recollect, however, one thing, either in distance or
nearness&mdash;every day which keeps us asunder should, after so long
a period, rather soften our mutual feelings; which must always have
one rallying point as long as our child exists, which, I presume, we
both hope will be long after either of her parents.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The time which has elapsed since the separation has been considerably
more than the whole brief period of our union, and the not much longer
one of our prior acquaintance.&nbsp; We both made a bitter mistake;
but now it is over, and irrevocably so.&nbsp; For at thirty-three on
my part, and few years less on yours, though it is no very extended
period of life, still it is one when the habits and thought are generally
so formed as to admit of no modification; and, as we could not agree
when younger, we should with difficulty do so now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say all this, because I own to you, that notwithstanding
everything, I considered our reunion as not impossible for more than
a year after the separation; but then I gave up the hope entirely and
for ever.&nbsp; But this very impossibility of reunion seems to me at
least a reason why, on all the few points of discussion which can arise
between us, we should preserve the courtesies of life, and as much of
its kindness as people who are never to meet may preserve,&mdash;perhaps
more easily than nearer connections.&nbsp; For my own part, I am violent,
but not malignant; for only fresh provocations can awaken my resentments.&nbsp;
To you, who are colder and more concentrated, I would just hint, that
you may sometimes mistake the depth of a cold anger for dignity, and
a worse feeling for duty.&nbsp; I assure you that I bear you <i>now</i>
(whatever I may have done) no resentment whatever.&nbsp; Remember, that,
<i>if you have injured me</i> in aught, this forgiveness is something;
and that, if I have <i>injured you</i>, it is something more still,
if it be true, as the moralists say, that the most offending are the
least forgiving.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whether the offence has been solely on my side, or reciprocal,
or on yours chiefly, I have ceased to reflect upon any but two things;
viz., that you are the mother of my child, and that we shall never meet
again.&nbsp; I think, if you also consider the two corresponding points
with reference to myself, it will be better for all three.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Yours
ever,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;NOEL
BYRON.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The artless Thomas Moore introduces this letter in the &lsquo;Life,&rsquo;
with the remark,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There are few, I should think, of my readers, who will not
agree with me in pronouncing, that, if the author of the following letter
had not <i>right</i> on his side, he had at least most of those good
feelings which are found in general to accompany it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The reader is requested to take notice of the important admission;
that <i>the letter was never sent to Lady Byron at all</i>.&nbsp; It
was, in fact, never <i>intended</i> for her, but was a nice little dramatic
performance, composed simply with the view of acting on the sympathies
of Lady Blessington and Byron&rsquo;s numerous female admirers; and
the reader will agree with us, we think, that, in this point of view,
it was very neatly done, and deserves immortality as a work of high
art.&nbsp; For six years he had been plunged into every kind of vice
and excess, pleading his shattered domestic joys, and his wife&rsquo;s
obdurate heart, as the apology and the impelling cause; filling the
air with his shrieks and complaints concerning the slander which pursued
him, while he filled letters to his confidential correspondents with
records of new mistresses.&nbsp; During all these years, the silence
of Lady Byron was unbroken; though Lord Byron not only drew in private
on the sympathies of his female admirers, but employed his talents and
position as an author in holding her up to contempt and ridicule before
thousands of readers.&nbsp; We shall quote at length his side of the
story, which he published in the First Canto of &lsquo;Don Juan,&rsquo;
that the reader may see how much reason he had for assuming the injured
tone which he did in the letter to Lady Byron quoted above.&nbsp; That
letter never was sent to her; and the unmanly and indecent caricature
of her, and the indelicate exposure of the whole story on his own side,
which we are about to quote, were the only communications that could
have reached her solitude.</p>
<p>In the following verses, Lady Byron is represented as Donna Inez,
and Lord Byron as Don Jos&eacute;; but the incidents and allusions were
so very pointed, that nobody for a moment doubted whose history the
poet was narrating.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;His mother was a learned lady, famed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For every branch of every science known<br />
In every Christian language ever named,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With virtues equalled by her wit alone:<br />
She made the cleverest people quite ashamed;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And even the good with inward envy groaned,<br />
Finding themselves so very much exceeded<br />
In their own way by all the things that she did.<br />
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br />
Save that her duty both to man and God<br />
Required this conduct; which seemed very odd.</p>
<p>She kept a journal where his faults were noted,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And opened certain trunks of books and letters,<br />
(All which might, if occasion served, be quoted);<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And then she had all Seville for abettors,<br />
Besides her good old grandmother (who doted):<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The hearers of her case become repeaters,<br />
Then advocates, inquisitors, and judges,&mdash;<br />
Some for amusement, others for old grudges.</p>
<p>And then this best and meekest woman bore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With such serenity her husband&rsquo;s woes!<br />
Just as the Spartan ladies did of yore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who saw their spouses killed, and nobly chose<br />
Never to say a word about them more.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Calmly she heard each calumny that rose,<br />
And saw his agonies with such sublimity,<br />
That all the world exclaimed, &ldquo;What magnanimity!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the longest and most elaborate version of his own story that
Byron ever published; but he busied himself with many others, projecting
at one time a Spanish romance, in which the same story is related in
the same transparent manner: but this he was dissuaded from printing.&nbsp;
The booksellers, however, made a good speculation in publishing what
they called his domestic poems; that is, poems bearing more or less
relation to this subject.</p>
<p>Every person with whom he became acquainted with any degree of intimacy
was made familiar with his side of the story.&nbsp; Moore&rsquo;s Biography
is from first to last, in its representations, founded upon Byron&rsquo;s
communicativeness, and Lady Byron&rsquo;s silence; and the world at
last settled down to believing that the account so often repeated, and
never contradicted, must be substantially a true one.</p>
<p>The true history of Lord and Lady Byron has long been perfectly understood
in many circles in England; but the facts were of a nature that could
not be made public.&nbsp; While there was a young daughter living whose
future might be prejudiced by its recital, and while there were other
persons on whom the disclosure of the real truth would have been crushing
as an avalanche, Lady Byron&rsquo;s only course was the perfect silence
in which she took refuge, and those sublime works of charity and mercy
to which she consecrated her blighted early life.</p>
<p>But the time is now come when the truth may be told.&nbsp; All the
actors in the scene have disappeared from the stage of mortal existence,
and passed, let us have faith to hope, into a world where they would
desire to expiate their faults by a late publication of the truth.</p>
<p>No person in England, we think, would as yet take the responsibility
of relating the true history which is to clear Lady Byron&rsquo;s memory;
but, by a singular concurrence of circumstances, all the facts of the
case, in the most undeniable and authentic form, were at one time placed
in the hands of the writer of this sketch, with authority to make such
use of them as she should judge best.&nbsp; Had this melancholy history
been allowed to sleep, no public use would have been made of them; but
the appearance of a popular attack on the character of Lady Byron calls
for a vindication, and the true story of her married life will therefore
now be related.</p>
<p>Lord Byron has described in one of his letters the impression left
upon his mind by a young person whom he met one evening in society,
and who attracted his attention by the simplicity of her dress, and
a certain air of singular purity and calmness with which she surveyed
the scene around her.</p>
<p>On inquiry, he was told that this young person was Miss Milbanke,
an only child, and one of the largest heiresses in England.</p>
<p>Lord Byron was fond of idealising his experiences in poetry; and
the friends of Lady Byron had no difficulty in recognising the portrait
of Lady Byron, as she appeared at this time of her life, in his exquisite
description of Aurora Raby:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;There
was<br />
Indeed a certain fair and fairy one,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the best class, and better than her class,&mdash;<br />
Aurora Raby, a young star who shone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er life, too sweet an image for such glass;<br />
A lovely being scarcely formed or moulded;<br />
A rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded.</p>
<p>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .</p>
<p>Early in years, and yet more infantine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In figure, she had something of sublime<br />
In eyes which sadly shone as seraphs&rsquo; shine;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All youth, but with an aspect beyond time;<br />
Radiant and grave, as pitying man&rsquo;s decline;<br />
Mournful, but mournful of another&rsquo;s crime,<br />
She looked as if she sat by Eden&rsquo;s door,<br />
And grieved for those who could return no more.</p>
<p>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .</p>
<p>She gazed upon a world she scarcely knew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As seeking not to know it; silent, lone,<br />
As grows a flower, thus quietly she grew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And kept her heart serene within its zone.<br />
There was awe in the homage which she drew;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her spirit seemed as seated on a throne,<br />
Apart from the surrounding world, and strong<br />
In its own strength,&mdash;most strange in one so young!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some idea of the course which their acquaintance took, and of the
manner in which he was piqued into thinking of her, is given in a stanza
or two:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The dashing and proud air of Adeline<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Imposed not upon her: she saw her blaze<br />
Much as she would have seen a glow-worm shine;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Then turned unto the stars for loftier rays.<br />
Juan was something she could not divine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Being no sibyl in the new world&rsquo;s ways;<br />
Yet she was nothing dazzled by the meteor,<br />
Because she did not pin her faith on feature.</p>
<p>His fame too (for he had that kind of fame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which sometimes plays the deuce with womankind,&mdash;<br />
A heterogeneous mass of glorious blame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Half virtues and whole vices being combined;<br />
Faults which attract because they are not tame;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Follies tricked out so brightly that they blind),&mdash;<br />
These seals upon her wax made no impression,<br />
Such was her coldness or her self-possession.</p>
<p>Aurora sat with that indifference<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which piques a preux chevalier,&mdash;as it ought.<br />
Of all offences, that&rsquo;s the worst offence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which seems to hint you are not worth a thought.</p>
<p>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .</p>
<p>To his gay nothings, nothing was replied,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or something which was nothing, as urbanity<br />
Required.&nbsp; Aurora scarcely looked aside,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor even smiled enough for any vanity.<br />
The Devil was in the girl!&nbsp; Could it be pride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or modesty, or absence, or inanity?</p>
<p>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .</p>
<p>Juan was drawn thus into some attentions,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Slight but select, and just enough to express,<br />
To females of perspicuous comprehensions,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That he would rather make them more than less.<br />
Aurora at the last (so history mentions,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though probably much less a fact than guess)<br />
So far relaxed her thoughts from their sweet prison<br />
As once or twice to smile, if not to listen.</p>
<p>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .</p>
<p>But Juan had a sort of winning way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A proud humility, if such there be,<br />
Which showed such deference to what females say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As if each charming word were a decree.<br />
His tact, too, tempered him from grave to gay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And taught him when to be reserved or free.<br />
He had the art of drawing people out,<br />
Without their seeing what he was about.</p>
<p>Aurora, who in her indifference,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Confounded him in common with the crowd<br />
Of flatterers, though she deemed he had more sense<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than whispering foplings or than witlings loud,<br />
Commenced (from such slight things will great commence)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To feel that flattery which attracts the proud,<br />
Rather by deference than compliment,<br />
And wins even by a delicate dissent.</p>
<p>And then he had good looks: that point was carried<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nem. con. amongst the women.</p>
<p>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, though we know of old that looks deceive,<br />
And always have done, somehow these good looks,<br />
Make more impression than the best of books.</p>
<p>Aurora, who looked more on books than faces,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was very young, although so very sage:<br />
Admiring more Minerva than the Graces,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially upon a printed page.<br />
But Virtue&rsquo;s self, with all her tightest laces,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has not the natural stays of strict old age;<br />
And Socrates, that model of all duty,<br />
Owned to a penchant, though discreet for beauty.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The presence of this high-minded, thoughtful, unworldly woman is
described through two cantos of the wild, rattling &lsquo;Don Juan,&rsquo;
in a manner that shows how deeply the poet was capable of being affected
by such an appeal to his higher nature.</p>
<p>For instance, when Don Juan sits silent and thoughtful amid a circle
of persons who are talking scandal, the poet says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis true, he saw Aurora look as though<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She approved his silence: she perhaps mistook<br />
Its motive for that charity we owe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But seldom pay, the absent.</p>
<p>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .</p>
<p>He gained esteem where it was worth the most;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And certainly Aurora had renewed<br />
In him some feelings he had lately lost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or hardened,&mdash;feelings which, perhaps ideal,<br />
Are so divine that I must deem them real:&mdash;</p>
<p>The love of higher things and better days;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The unbounded hope and heavenly ignorance<br />
Of what is called the world and the world&rsquo;s ways;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The moments when we gather from a glance<br />
More joy than from all future pride or praise,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which kindled manhood, but can ne&rsquo;er entrance<br />
The heart in an existence of its own<br />
Of which another&rsquo;s bosom is the zone.</p>
<p>And full of sentiments sublime as billows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Heaving between this world and worlds beyond,<br />
Don Juan, when the midnight hour of pillows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Arrived, retired to his.&rsquo; . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In all these descriptions of a spiritual unworldly nature acting
on the spiritual and unworldly part of his own nature, every one who
ever knew Lady Byron intimately must have recognised the model from
which he drew, and the experience from which he spoke, even though nothing
was further from his mind than to pay this tribute to the woman he had
injured, and though before these lines, which showed how truly he knew
her real character, had come one stanza of ribald, vulgar caricature,
designed as a slight to her:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;There was Miss Millpond, smooth as summer&rsquo;s
sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That usual paragon, an only daughter,<br />
Who seemed the cream of equanimity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Till skimmed; and then there was some milk and water;<br />
With a slight shade of blue, too, it might be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath the surface: but what did it matter?<br />
Love&rsquo;s riotous; but marriage should have quiet,<br />
And, being consumptive, live on a milk diet.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The result of Byron&rsquo;s intimacy with Miss Milbanke and the enkindling
of his nobler feelings was an offer of marriage, which she, though at
the time deeply interested in him, declined with many expressions of
friendship and interest.&nbsp; In fact, she already loved him, but had
that doubt of her power to be to him all that a wife should be, which
would be likely to arise in a mind so sensitively constituted and so
unworldly.&nbsp; They, however, continued a correspondence as friends;
on her part, the interest continually increased; on his, the transient
rise of better feelings was choked and overgrown by the thorns of base
unworthy passions.</p>
<p>From the height at which he might have been happy as the husband
of a noble woman, he fell into the depths of a secret adulterous intrigue
with a blood relation, so near in consanguinity, that discovery must
have been utter ruin and expulsion from civilised society.</p>
<p>From henceforth, this damning guilty secret became the ruling force
in his life; holding him with a morbid fascination, yet filling him
with remorse and anguish, and insane dread of detection.&nbsp; Two years
after his refusal by Miss Milbanke, his various friends, seeing that
for some cause he was wretched, pressed marriage upon him.</p>
<p>Marriage has often been represented as the proper goal and terminus
of a wild and dissipated career; and it has been supposed to be the
appointed mission of good women to receive wandering prodigals, with
all the rags and disgraces of their old life upon them, and put rings
on their hands, and shoes on their feet, and introduce them, clothed
and in their right minds, to an honourable career in society.</p>
<p>Marriage was, therefore, universally recommended to Lord Byron by
his numerous friends and well-wishers; and so he determined to marry,
and, in an hour of reckless desperation, sat down and wrote proposals
to two ladies.&nbsp; One was declined: the other, which was accepted,
was to Miss Milbanke.&nbsp; The world knows well that he had the gift
of expression, and will not be surprised that he wrote a very beautiful
letter, and that the woman who had already learned to love him fell
at once into the snare.</p>
<p>Her answer was a frank, outspoken avowal of her love for him, giving
herself to him heart and hand.&nbsp; The good in Lord Byron was not
so utterly obliterated that he could receive such a letter without emotion,
or practise such unfairness on a loving, trusting heart without pangs
of remorse.&nbsp; He had sent the letter in mere recklessness; he had
not seriously expected to be accepted; and the discovery of the treasure
of affection which he had secured was like a vision of lost heaven to
a soul in hell.</p>
<p>But, nevertheless, in his letters written about the engagement, there
are sufficient evidences that his self-love was flattered at the preference
accorded him by so superior a woman, and one who had been so much sought.&nbsp;
He mentions with an air of complacency that she has employed the last
two years in refusing five or six of his acquaintance; that he had no
idea she loved him, admitting that it was an old attachment on his part.&nbsp;
He dwells on her virtues with a sort of pride of ownership.&nbsp; There
is a sort of childish levity about the frankness of these letters, very
characteristic of the man who skimmed over the deepest abysses with
the lightest jests.&nbsp; Before the world, and to his intimates, he
was acting the part of the successful <i>fianc&eacute;</i>, conscious
all the while of the deadly secret that lay cold at the bottom of his
heart.</p>
<p>When he went to visit Miss Milbanke&rsquo;s parents as her accepted
lover, she was struck with his manner and appearance: she saw him moody
and gloomy, evidently wrestling with dark and desperate thoughts, and
anything but what a happy and accepted lover should be.&nbsp; She sought
an interview with him alone, and told him that she had observed that
he was not happy in the engagement; and magnanimously added, that, if
on review, he found he had been mistaken in the nature of his feelings,
she would immediately release him, and they should remain only friends.</p>
<p>Overcome with the conflict of his feelings, Lord Byron fainted away.&nbsp;
Miss Milbanke was convinced that his heart must really be deeply involved
in an attachment with reference to which he showed such strength of
emotion, and she spoke no more of a dissolution of the engagement.</p>
<p>There is no reason to doubt that Byron was, as he relates in his
&lsquo;Dream,&rsquo; profoundly agonized and agitated when he stood
before God&rsquo;s altar with the trusting young creature whom he was
leading to a fate so awfully tragic; yet it was not the memory of Mary
Chaworth, but another guiltier and more damning memory, that overshadowed
that hour.</p>
<p>The moment the carriage-doors were shut upon the bridegroom and the
bride, the paroxysm of remorse and despair&mdash;unrepentant remorse
and angry despair&mdash;broke forth upon her gentle head:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You might have saved me from this, madam!&nbsp; You had all
in your own power when I offered myself to you first.&nbsp; Then you
might have made me what you pleased; but now you will find that you
have married a <i>devil</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In Miss Martineau&rsquo;s Sketches, recently published, is an account
of the termination of this wedding-journey, which brought them to one
of Lady Byron&rsquo;s ancestral country seats, where they were to spend
the honeymoon.</p>
<p>Miss Martineau says,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;At the altar she did not know that she was a sacrifice; but
before sunset of that winter day she knew it, if a judgment may be formed
from her face, and attitude of despair, when she alighted from the carriage
on the afternoon of her marriage-day.&nbsp; It was not the traces of
tears which won the sympathy of the old butler who stood at the open
door.&nbsp; The bridegroom jumped out of the carriage and walked away.&nbsp;
The bride alighted, and came up the steps alone, with a countenance
and frame agonized and listless with evident horror and despair.&nbsp;
The old servant longed to offer his arm to the young, lonely creature,
as an assurance of sympathy and protection.&nbsp; From this shock she
certainly rallied, and soon.&nbsp; The pecuniary difficulties of her
new home were exactly what a devoted spirit like hers was fitted to
encounter.&nbsp; Her husband bore testimony, after the catastrophe,
that a brighter being, a more sympathising and agreeable companion,
never blessed any man&rsquo;s home.&nbsp; When he afterwards called
her cold and mathematical, and over-pious, and so forth, it was when
public opinion had gone against him, and when he had discovered that
her fidelity and mercy, her silence and magnanimity, might be relied
on, so that he was at full liberty to make his part good, as far as
she was concerned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Silent she was even to her own parents, whose feelings she
magnanimously spared.&nbsp; She did not act rashly in leaving him, though
she had been most rash in marrying him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Not all at once did the full knowledge of the dreadful reality into
which she had entered come upon the young wife.&nbsp; She knew vaguely,
from the wild avowals of the first hours of their marriage, that there
was a dreadful secret of guilt; that Byron&rsquo;s soul was torn with
agonies of remorse, and that he had no love to give to her in return
for a love which was ready to do and dare all for him.&nbsp; Yet bravely
she addressed herself to the task of soothing and pleasing and calming
the man whom she had taken &lsquo;for better or for worse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Young and gifted; with a peculiar air of refined and spiritual beauty;
graceful in every movement; possessed of exquisite taste; a perfect
companion to his mind in all the higher walks of literary culture; and
with that infinite pliability to all his varying, capricious moods which
true love alone can give; bearing in her hand a princely fortune, which,
with a woman&rsquo;s uncalculating generosity, was thrown at his feet,&mdash;there
is no wonder that she might feel for a while as if she could enter the
lists with the very Devil himself, and fight with a woman&rsquo;s weapons
for the heart of her husband.</p>
<p>There are indications scattered through the letters of Lord Byron,
which, though brief indeed, showed that his young wife was making every
effort to accommodate herself to him, and to give him a cheerful home.&nbsp;
One of the poems that he sends to his publisher about this time, he
speaks of as being copied by her.&nbsp; He had always the highest regard
for her literary judgments and opinions; and this little incident shows
that she was already associating herself in a wifely fashion with his
aims as an author.</p>
<p>The poem copied by her, however, has a sad meaning, which she afterwards
learned to understand only too well:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s not a joy the world can give like
that it takes away<br />
When the glow of early thought declines in feeling&rsquo;s dull decay:<br />
&rsquo;Tis not on youth&rsquo;s smooth cheek the blush alone that fades
so fast;<br />
But the tender bloom of heart is gone e&rsquo;er youth itself be past.<br />
Then the few whose spirits float above the wreck of happiness<br />
Are driven o&rsquo;er the shoals of guilt, or ocean of excess:<br />
The magnet of their course is gone, or only points in vain<br />
The shore to which their shivered sail shall never stretch again.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only a few days before she left him for ever, Lord Byron sent Murray
manuscripts, in Lady Byron&rsquo;s handwriting, of the &lsquo;Siege
of Corinth,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Parisina,&rsquo; and wrote,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am very glad that the handwriting was a favourable omen
of the <i>morale</i> of the piece: but you must not trust to that; for
my copyist would write out anything I desired, in all the ignorance
of innocence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There were lucid intervals in which Lord Byron felt the charm of
his wife&rsquo;s mind, and the strength of her powers.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bell,
you could be a poet too, if you only thought so,&rsquo; he would say.&nbsp;
There were summer-hours in her stormy life, the memory of which never
left her, when Byron was as gentle and tender as he was beautiful; when
he seemed to be possessed by a good angel: and then for a little time
all the ideal possibilities of his nature stood revealed.</p>
<p>The most dreadful men to live with are those who thus alternate between
angel and devil.&nbsp; The buds of hope and love called out by a day
or two of sunshine are frozen again and again, till the tree is killed.</p>
<p>But there came an hour of revelation,&mdash;an hour when, in a manner
which left no kind of room for doubt, Lady Byron saw the full depth
of the abyss of infamy which her marriage was expected to cover, and
understood that she was expected to be the cloak and the accomplice
of this infamy.</p>
<p>Many women would have been utterly crushed by such a disclosure;
some would have fled from him immediately, and exposed and denounced
the crime.&nbsp; Lady Byron did neither.&nbsp; When all the hope of
womanhood died out of her heart, there arose within her, stronger, purer,
and brighter, that immortal kind of love such as God feels for the sinner,&mdash;the
love of which Jesus spoke, and which holds the one wanderer of more
account than the ninety and nine that went not astray.&nbsp; She would
neither leave her husband nor betray him, nor yet would she for one
moment justify his sin; and hence came two years of convulsive struggle,
in which sometimes, for a while, the good angel seemed to gain ground,
and then the evil one returned with sevenfold vehemence.</p>
<p>Lord Byron argued his case with himself and with her with all the
sophistries of his powerful mind.&nbsp; He repudiated Christianity as
authority; asserted the right of every human being to follow out what
he called &lsquo;the impulses of nature.&rsquo;&nbsp; Subsequently he
introduced into one of his dramas the reasoning by which he justified
himself in incest.</p>
<p>In the drama of &lsquo;Cain,&rsquo; Adah, the sister and the wife
of Cain, thus addresses him:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Cain, walk not with this spirit.<br />
Bear with what we have borne, and love me: I<br />
Love thee.</p>
<p>Lucifer.&nbsp; More than thy mother and thy sire?</p>
<p>Adah.&nbsp; I do.&nbsp; Is that a sin, too?</p>
<p>Lucifer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
No, not yet:<br />
It one day will be in your children.</p>
<p>Adah.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What!<br />
Must not my daughter love her brother Enoch?</p>
<p>Lucifer.&nbsp; Not as thou lovest Cain.</p>
<p>Adah.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
O my God!<br />
Shall they not love, and bring forth things that love<br />
Out of their love?&nbsp; Have they not drawn their milk<br />
Out of this bosom?&nbsp; Was not he, their father,<br />
Born of the same sole womb, in the same hour<br />
With me?&nbsp; Did we not love each other, and,<br />
In multiplying our being, multiply<br />
Things which will love each other as we love<br />
Them?&nbsp; And as I love thee, my Cain, go not<br />
Forth with this spirit: he is not of ours.</p>
<p>Lucifer.&nbsp; The sin I speak of is not of my making<br />
And cannot be a sin in you, whate&rsquo;er<br />
It seems in those who will replace ye in<br />
Mortality.</p>
<p>Adah.&nbsp; What is the sin which is not<br />
Sin in itself?&nbsp; Can circumstance make sin<br />
Of virtue?&nbsp; If it doth, we are the slaves<br />
Of&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lady Byron, though slight and almost infantine in her bodily presence,
had the soul, not only of an angelic woman, but of a strong reasoning
man.&nbsp; It was the writer&rsquo;s lot to know her at a period when
she formed the personal acquaintance of many of the very first minds
of England; but, among all with whom this experience brought her in
connection, there was none who impressed her so strongly as Lady Byron.&nbsp;
There was an almost supernatural power of moral divination, a grasp
of the very highest and most comprehensive things, that made her lightest
opinions singularly impressive.&nbsp; No doubt, this result was wrought
out in a great degree from the anguish and conflict of these two years,
when, with no one to help or counsel her but Almighty God, she wrestled
and struggled with fiends of darkness for the redemption of her husband&rsquo;s
soul.</p>
<p>She followed him through all his sophistical reasonings with a keener
reason.&nbsp; She besought and implored, in the name of his better nature,
and by all the glorious things that he was capable of being and doing;
and she had just power enough to convulse and shake and agonise, but
not power enough to subdue.</p>
<p>One of the first of living writers, in the novel of &lsquo;Romola,&rsquo;
has given, in her masterly sketch of the character of Tito, the whole
history of the conflict of a woman like Lady Byron with a nature like
that of her husband.&nbsp; She has described a being full of fascinations
and sweetnesses, full of generosities and of good-natured impulses;
a nature that could not bear to give pain, or to see it in others, but
entirely destitute of any firm moral principle; she shows how such a
being, merely by yielding step by step to the impulses of passion, and
disregarding the claims of truth and right, becomes involved in a fatality
of evil, in which deceit, crime, and cruelty are a necessity, forcing
him to persist in the basest ingratitude to the father who has done
all for him, and hard-hearted treachery to the high-minded wife who
has given herself to him wholly.</p>
<p>There are few scenes in literature more fearfully tragic than the
one between Romola and Tito, when he finally discovers that she knows
him fully, and can be deceived by him no more.&nbsp; Some such hour
always must come for strong decided natures irrevocably pledged&mdash;one
to the service of good, and the other to the slavery of evil.&nbsp;
The demoniac cried out, &lsquo;What have I to do with thee, Jesus of
Nazareth?&nbsp; Art thou come to torment me before the time?&rsquo;&nbsp;
The presence of all-pitying purity and love was a torture to the soul
possessed by the demon of evil.</p>
<p>These two years in which Lady Byron was with all her soul struggling
to bring her husband back to his better self were a series of passionate
convulsions.</p>
<p>During this time, such was the disordered and desperate state of
his worldly affairs, that there were ten executions for debt levied
on their family establishment; and it was Lady Byron&rsquo;s fortune
each time which settled the account.</p>
<p>Toward the last, she and her husband saw less and less of each other;
and he came more and more decidedly under evil influences, and seemed
to acquire a sort of hatred of her.</p>
<p>Lady Byron once said significantly to a friend who spoke of some
causeless dislike in another, &lsquo;My dear, I have known people to
be hated for no other reason than because they impersonated conscience.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The biographers of Lord Byron, and all his apologists, are careful
to narrate how sweet and amiable and obliging he was to everybody who
approached him; and the saying of Fletcher, his man-servant, that <i>&lsquo;anybody</i>
could do anything with my Lord, except my Lady,&rsquo; has often been
quoted.</p>
<p>The reason of all this will now be evident.&nbsp; &lsquo;My Lady&rsquo;
was the only one, fully understanding the deep and dreadful secrets
of his life, who had the courage resolutely and persistently and inflexibly
to plant herself in his way, and insist upon it, that, if he went to
destruction, it should be in spite of her best efforts.</p>
<p>He had tried his strength with her fully.&nbsp; The first attempt
had been to make her an accomplice by sophistry; by destroying her faith
in Christianity, and confusing her sense of right and wrong, to bring
her into the ranks of those convenient women who regard the marriage-tie
only as a friendly alliance to cover licence on both sides.</p>
<p>When her husband described to her the Continental latitude (the good-humoured
marriage, in which complaisant couples mutually agreed to form the cloak
for each other&rsquo;s infidelities), and gave her to understand that
in this way alone she could have a peaceful and friendly life with him,
she answered him simply, &lsquo;I am too truly your friend to do this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Lord Byron found that he had to do with one who would not yield,
who knew him fully, who could not be blinded and could not be deceived,
he determined to rid himself of her altogether.</p>
<p>It was when the state of affairs between herself and her husband
seemed darkest and most hopeless, that the only child of this union
was born.&nbsp; Lord Byron&rsquo;s treatment of his wife during the
sensitive period that preceded the birth of this child, and during her
confinement, was marked by paroxysms of unmanly brutality, for which
the only possible charity on her part was the supposition of insanity.&nbsp;
Moore sheds a significant light on this period, by telling us that,
about this time, Byron was often drunk, day after day, with Sheridan.&nbsp;
There had been insanity in the family; and this was the plea which Lady
Byron&rsquo;s love put in for him.&nbsp; She regarded him as, if not
insane, at least so nearly approaching the boundaries of insanity as
to be a subject of forbearance and tender pity; and she loved him with
that love resembling a mother&rsquo;s, which good wives often feel when
they have lost all faith in their husband&rsquo;s principles, and all
hopes of their affections.&nbsp; Still, she was in heart and soul his
best friend; true to him with a truth which he himself could not shake.</p>
<p>In the verses addressed to his daughter, Lord Byron speaks of her
as</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The child of love, though born in bitterness,<br />
And nurtured in convulsion.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A day or two after the birth of this child, Lord Byron came suddenly
into Lady Byron&rsquo;s room, and told her that her mother was dead.&nbsp;
It was an utter falsehood; but it was only one of the many nameless
injuries and cruelties by which he expressed his hatred of her.&nbsp;
A short time after her confinement, she was informed by him, in a note,
that, as soon as she was able to travel, she must go; that he could
not and would not longer have her about him; and, when her child was
only five weeks old, he carried this threat of expulsion into effect.</p>
<p>Here we will insert briefly Lady Byron&rsquo;s own account (the only
one she ever gave to the public) of this separation.&nbsp; The circumstances
under which this brief story was written are affecting.</p>
<p>Lord Byron was dead.&nbsp; The whole account between him and her
was closed for ever in this world.&nbsp; Moore&rsquo;s &lsquo;Life&rsquo;
had been prepared, containing simply and solely Lord Byron&rsquo;s own
version of their story.&nbsp; Moore sent this version to Lady Byron,
and requested to know if she had any remarks to make upon it.&nbsp;
In reply, she sent a brief statement to him,&mdash;the first and only
one that had come from her during all the years of the separation, and
which appears to have mainly for its object the exculpation of her father
and mother from the charge, made by the poet, of being the instigators
of the separation.</p>
<p>In this letter, she says, with regard to their separation,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The facts are, I left London for Kirkby Mallory, the residence
of my father and mother, on the 15th of January, 1816.&nbsp; LORD BYRON
HAD SIGNIFIED TO ME IN WRITING, JAN. 6, HIS ABSOLUTE DESIRE THAT I SHOULD
LEAVE LONDON ON THE EARLIEST DAY THAT I COULD CONVENIENTLY FIX.&nbsp;
It was not safe for me to undertake the fatigue of a journey sooner
than the 15th.&nbsp; Previously to my departure, it had been strongly
impressed upon my mind that Lord Byron was under the influence of insanity.&nbsp;
This opinion was derived, in a great measure, from the communications
made me by his nearest relatives and personal attendant, who had more
opportunity than myself for observing him during the latter part of
my stay in town.&nbsp; It was even represented to me that he was in
danger of destroying himself.</p>
<p><i>&lsquo;With the concurrence of his family</i>, I had consulted
Dr. Baillie as a friend (Jan. 8) respecting the supposed malady.&nbsp;
On acquainting him with the state of the case, and with Lord Byron&rsquo;s
desire that I should leave London, Dr. Baillie thought that my absence
might be advisable as an experiment, assuming the fact of mental derangement;
for Dr. Baillie, not having had access to Lord Byron, could not pronounce
a positive opinion on that point.&nbsp; He enjoined that, in correspondence
with Lord Byron, I should avoid all but light and soothing topics.&nbsp;
Under these impressions, I left London, determined to follow the advice
given by Dr. Baillie.&nbsp; Whatever might have been the conduct of
Lord Byron toward me from the time of my marriage, yet, supposing him
to be in a state of mental alienation, it was not for <i>me</i>, nor
for any person of common humanity, to manifest at that moment a sense
of injury.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nothing more than this letter from Lady Byron is necessary to substantiate
the fact, that she did not <i>leave</i> her husband, but <i>was driven</i>
from him,&mdash;driven from him that he might give himself up to the
guilty infatuation that was consuming him, without being tortured by
her imploring face, and by the silent power of her presence and her
prayers.</p>
<p>For a long time before this, she had seen little of him.&nbsp; On
the day of her departure, she passed by the door of his room, and stopped
to caress his favourite spaniel, which was lying there; and she confessed
to a friend the weakness of feeling a willingness even to be something
as humble as that poor little creature, might she only be allowed to
remain and watch over him.&nbsp; She went into the room where he and
the partner of his sins were sitting together, and said, &lsquo;Byron,
I come to say goodbye,&rsquo; offering, at the same time, her hand.</p>
<p>Lord Byron put his hands behind him, retreated to the mantel-piece,
and, looking on the two that stood there, with a sarcastic smile said,
&lsquo;When shall we three meet again?&rsquo;&nbsp; Lady Byron answered,
&lsquo;In heaven, I trust&rsquo;.&nbsp; And those were her last words
to him on earth.</p>
<p>Now, if the reader wishes to understand the real talents of Lord
Byron for deception and dissimulation, let him read, with this story
in his mind, the &lsquo;Fare thee well,&rsquo; which he addressed to
Lady Byron through the printer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Fare thee well; and if for ever,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still for ever fare thee well!<br />
Even though unforgiving, never<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Gainst thee shall my heart rebel.</p>
<p>Would that breast were bared before thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where thy head so oft hath lain,<br />
While that placid sleep came o&rsquo;er thee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou canst never know again!</p>
<p>Though my many faults defaced me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could no other arm be found<br />
Than the one which once embraced me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To inflict a careless wound?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The re-action of society against him at the time of the separation
from his wife was something which he had not expected, and for which,
it appears, he was entirely unprepared.&nbsp; It broke up the guilty
intrigue and drove him from England.&nbsp; He had not courage to meet
or endure it.&nbsp; The world, to be sure, was very far from suspecting
what the truth was: but the tide was setting against him with such vehemence
as to make him tremble every hour lest the whole should be known; and
henceforth, it became a warfare of desperation to make his story good,
no matter at whose expense.</p>
<p>He had tact enough to perceive at first that the assumption of the
pathetic and the magnanimous, and general confessions of faults, accompanied
with admissions of his wife&rsquo;s goodness, would be the best policy
in his case.&nbsp; In this mood, he thus writes to Moore:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The fault was not in my choice (unless in choosing at all);
for I do not believe (and I must say it in the very dregs of all this
bitter business) that there ever was a better, or even a brighter, a
kinder, or a more amiable, agreeable being than Lady Byron.&nbsp; I
never had, nor can have, any reproach to make her while with me.&nbsp;
Where there is blame, it belongs to myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As there must be somewhere a scapegoat to bear the sin of the affair,
Lord Byron wrote a poem called &lsquo;A Sketch,&rsquo; in which he lays
the blame of stirring up strife on a friend and former governess of
Lady Byron&rsquo;s; but in this sketch he introduces the following just
eulogy on Lady Byron:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Foiled was perversion by that
youthful mind<br />
Which flattery fooled not, baseness could not blind,<br />
Deceit infect not, near contagion soil,<br />
Indulgence weaken, nor example spoil,<br />
Nor mastered science tempt her to look down<br />
On humbler talents with a pitying frown,<br />
Nor genius swell, nor beauty render vain,<br />
Nor envy ruffle to retaliate pain,<br />
Nor fortune change, pride raise, nor passion bow,<br />
Nor virtue teach austerity,&mdash;till now;<br />
Serenely purest of her sex that live,<br />
But wanting one sweet weakness,&mdash;to forgive;<br />
Too shocked at faults her soul can never know,<br />
She deemed that all could be like her below:<br />
Foe to all vice, yet hardly Virtue&rsquo;s friend;<br />
For Virtue pardons those she would amend.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In leaving England, Lord Byron first went to Switzerland, where he
conceived and in part wrote out the tragedy of &lsquo;Manfred.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Moore speaks of his domestic misfortunes, and the sufferings which he
underwent at this time, as having influence in stimulating his genius,
so that he was enabled to write with a greater power.</p>
<p>Anybody who reads the tragedy of &lsquo;Manfred&rsquo; with this
story in his mind will see that it is true.</p>
<p>The hero is represented as a gloomy misanthrope, dwelling with impenitent
remorse on the memory of an incestuous passion which has been the destruction
of his sister for this life and the life to come, but which, to the
very last gasp, he despairingly refuses to repent of, even while he
sees the fiends of darkness rising to take possession of his departing
soul.&nbsp; That Byron knew his own guilt well, and judged himself severely,
may be gathered from passages in this poem, which are as powerful as
human language can be made; for instance this part of the &lsquo;incantation,&rsquo;
which Moore says was written at this time:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Though thy slumber may be deep,<br />
Yet thy spirit shall not sleep:<br />
There are shades which will not vanish;<br />
There are thoughts thou canst not banish.<br />
By a power to thee unknown,<br />
Thou canst never be alone:<br />
Thou art wrapt as with a shroud;<br />
Thou art gathered in a cloud;<br />
And for ever shalt thou dwell<br />
In the spirit of this spell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.</p>
<p>From thy false tears I did distil<br />
An essence which had strength to kill;<br />
From thy own heart I then did wring<br />
The black blood in its blackest spring;<br />
From thy own smile I snatched the snake,<br />
For there it coiled as in a brake;<br />
From thy own lips I drew the charm<br />
Which gave all these their chiefest harm:<br />
In proving every poison known,<br />
I found the strongest was thine own.</p>
<p>By thy cold breast and serpent smile,<br />
By thy unfathomed gulfs of guile,<br />
By that most seeming virtuous eye,<br />
By thy shut soul&rsquo;s hypocrisy,<br />
By the perfection of thine art<br />
Which passed for human thine own heart,<br />
By thy delight in other&rsquo;s pain,<br />
And by thy brotherhood of Cain,<br />
I call upon thee, and compel<br />
Thyself to be thy proper hell!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again: he represents Manfred as saying to the old abbot, who seeks
to bring him to repentance,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Old man, there is no power in holy men,<br />
Nor charm in prayer, nor purifying form<br />
Of penitence, nor outward look, nor fast,<br />
Nor agony, nor greater than all these,<br />
The innate tortures of that deep despair,<br />
Which is remorse without the fear of hell,<br />
But, all in all sufficient to itself,<br />
Would make a hell of heaven, can exorcise<br />
From out the unbounded spirit the quick sense<br />
Of its own sins, wrongs, sufferance, and revenge<br />
Upon itself: there is no future pang<br />
Can deal that justice on the self-condemned<br />
He deals on his own soul.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And when the abbot tells him,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;All this is well;<br />
For this will pass away, and be succeeded<br />
By an auspicious hope, which shall look up<br />
With calm assurance to that blessed place<br />
Which all who seek may win, whatever be<br />
Their earthly errors,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>he answers,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;It is too late.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the old abbot soliloquises:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;This should have been a noble creature: he<br />
Hath all the energy which would have made<br />
A goodly frame of glorious elements,<br />
Had they been wisely mingled; as it is,<br />
It is an awful chaos,&mdash;light and darkness,<br />
And mind and dust, and passions and pure thoughts,<br />
Mixed, and contending without end or order.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The world can easily see, in Moore&rsquo;s Biography, what, after
this, was the course of Lord Byron&rsquo;s life; how he went from shame
to shame, and dishonour to dishonour, and used the fortune which his
wife brought him in the manner described in those private letters which
his biographer was left to print.&nbsp; Moore, indeed, says Byron had
made the resolution not to touch his lady&rsquo;s fortune; but adds,
that it required more self-command than he possessed to carry out so
honourable a purpose.</p>
<p>Lady Byron made but one condition with him.&nbsp; She had him in
her power; and she exacted that the unhappy partner of his sins should
not follow him out of England, and that the ruinous intrigue should
be given up.&nbsp; Her inflexibility on this point kept up that enmity
which was constantly expressing itself in some publication or other,
and which drew her and her private relations with him before the public.</p>
<p>The story of what Lady Byron did with the portion of her fortune
which was reserved to her is a record of noble and skilfully administered
charities.&nbsp; Pitiful and wise and strong, there was no form of human
suffering or sorrow that did not find with her refuge and help.&nbsp;
She gave not only systematically, but also impulsively.</p>
<p>Miss Martineau claims for her the honour of having first invented
practical schools, in which the children of the poor were turned into
agriculturists, artizans, seamstresses, and good wives for poor men.&nbsp;
While she managed with admirable skill and economy permanent institutions
of this sort, she was always ready to relieve suffering in any form.&nbsp;
The fugitive slaves William and Ellen Crafts, escaping to England, were
fostered by her protecting care.</p>
<p>In many cases where there was distress or anxiety from poverty among
those too self-respecting to make their sufferings known, the delicate
hand of Lady Byron ministered to the want with a consideration which
spared the most refined feelings.</p>
<p>As a mother, her course was embarrassed by peculiar trials.&nbsp;
The daughter inherited from the father not only brilliant talents, but
a restlessness and morbid sensibility which might be too surely traced
to the storms and agitations of the period in which she was born.&nbsp;
It was necessary to bring her up in ignorance of the true history of
her mother&rsquo;s life; and the consequence was that she could not
fully understand that mother.</p>
<p>During her early girlhood, her career was a source of more anxiety
than of comfort.&nbsp; She married a man of fashion, ran a brilliant
course as a gay woman of fashion, and died early of a lingering and
painful disease.</p>
<p>In the silence and shaded retirement of the sick-room, the daughter
came wholly back to her mother&rsquo;s arms and heart; and it was on
that mother&rsquo;s bosom that she leaned as she went down into the
dark valley.&nbsp; It was that mother who placed her weak and dying
hand in that of her Almighty Saviour.</p>
<p>To the children left by her daughter, she ministered with the faithfulness
of a guardian angel; and it is owing to her influence that those who
yet remain are among the best and noblest of mankind.</p>
<p>The person whose relations with Byron had been so disastrous, also,
in the latter years of her life, felt Lady Byron&rsquo;s loving and
ennobling influences, and, in her last sickness and dying hours, looked
to her for consolation and help.</p>
<p>There was an unfortunate child of sin, born with the curse upon her,
over whose wayward nature Lady Byron watched with a mother&rsquo;s tenderness.&nbsp;
She was the one who could have patience when the patience of every one
else failed; and though her task was a difficult one, from the strange
abnormal propensities to evil in the object of her cares, yet Lady Byron
never faltered, and never gave over, till death took the responsibility
from her hands.</p>
<p>During all this trial, strange to say, her belief that the good in
Lord Byron would finally conquer was unshaken.</p>
<p>To a friend who said to her, &lsquo;Oh! how could you love him?&rsquo;
she answered briefly, &lsquo;My dear, there was the angel in him.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It is in us all.</p>
<p>It was in this angel that she had faith.&nbsp; It was for the deliverance
of this angel from degradation and shame and sin that she unceasingly
prayed.&nbsp; She read every work that Byron wrote&mdash;read it with
a deeper knowledge than any human being but herself could possess.&nbsp;
The ribaldry and the obscenity and the insults with which he strove
to make her ridiculous in the world fell at her pitying feet unheeded.</p>
<p>When he broke away from all this unworthy life to devote himself
to a manly enterprise for the redemption of Greece, she thought that
she saw the beginning of an answer to her prayers.&nbsp; Even although
one of his latest acts concerning her was to repeat to Lady Blessington
the false accusation which made Lady Byron the author of all his errors,
she still had hopes from the one step taken in the right direction.</p>
<p>In the midst of these hopes came the news of his sudden death.&nbsp;
On his death-bed, it is well-known that he called his confidential English
servant to him, and said to him, &lsquo;Go to my sister; tell her&mdash;Go
to Lady Byron,&mdash;you will see her,&mdash;and say&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>Here followed twenty minutes of indistinct mutterings, in which the
names of his wife, daughter, and sister, frequently occurred.&nbsp;
He then said, &lsquo;Now I have told you all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My lord,&rsquo; replied Fletcher, &lsquo;I have not understood
a word your lordship has been saying.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not understand me!&rsquo; exclaimed Lord Byron with a look
of the utmost distress: &lsquo;what a pity!&nbsp; Then it is too late,&mdash;all
is over!&rsquo;&nbsp; He afterwards, says Moore, tried to utter a few
words, of which none were intelligible except &lsquo;My sister&mdash;my
child.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Fletcher returned to London, Lady Byron sent for him, and walked
the room in convulsive struggles to repress her tears and sobs, while
she over and over again strove to elicit something from him which should
enlighten her upon what that last message had been; but in vain: the
gates of eternity were shut in her face, and not a word had passed to
tell her if he had repented.</p>
<p>For all that, Lady Byron never doubted his salvation.&nbsp; Ever
before her, during the few remaining years of her widowhood, was the
image of her husband, purified and ennobled, with the shadows of earth
for ever dissipated, the stains of sin for ever removed; &lsquo;the
angel in him,&rsquo; as she expressed it, &lsquo;made perfect, according
to its divine ideal.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Never has more divine strength of faith and love existed in woman.&nbsp;
Out of the depths of her own loving and merciful nature, she gained
such views of the divine love and mercy as made all hopes possible.&nbsp;
There was no soul of whose future Lady Byron despaired,&mdash;such was
her boundless faith in the redeeming power of love.</p>
<p>After Byron&rsquo;s death, the life of this delicate creature&mdash;so
frail in body that she seemed always hovering on the brink of the eternal
world, yet so strong in spirit, and so unceasing in her various ministries
of mercy&mdash;was a miracle of mingled weakness and strength.</p>
<p>To talk with her seemed to the writer of this sketch the nearest
possible approach to talking with one of the spirits of the just made
perfect.</p>
<p>She was gentle, artless; approachable as a little child; with ready,
outflowing sympathy for the cares and sorrows and interests of all who
approached her; with a <i>na&iuml;ve</i> and gentle playfulness, that
adorned, without hiding, the breadth and strength of her mind; and,
above all, with a clear, divining, moral discrimination; never mistaking
wrong for right in the slightest shade, yet with a mercifulness that
made allowance for every weakness, and pitied every sin.</p>
<p>There was so much of Christ in her, that to have seen her seemed
to be to have drawn near to heaven.&nbsp; She was one of those few whom
absence cannot estrange from friends; whose mere presence in this world
seems always a help to every generous thought, a strength to every good
purpose, a comfort in every sorrow.</p>
<p>Living so near the confines of the spiritual world, she seemed already
to see into it: hence the words of comfort which she addressed to a
friend who had lost a son:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear friend, remember, as long as our loved ones are in <i>God&rsquo;s</i>
world, they are in <i>ours</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>It has been thought by some friends who have read the proof-sheets
of the foregoing that the author should give more specifically her authority
for these statements.</p>
<p>The circumstances which led the writer to England at a certain time
originated a friendship and correspondence with Lady Byron, which was
always regarded as one of the greatest acquisitions of that visit.</p>
<p>On the occasion of a second visit to England, in 1856, the writer
received a note from Lady Byron, indicating that she wished to have
some private, confidential conversation upon important subjects, and
inviting her, for that purpose, to spend a day with her at her country-seat
near London,</p>
<p>The writer went and spent a day with Lady Byron alone; and the object
of the invitation was explained to her.&nbsp; Lady Byron was in such
a state of health, that her physicians had warned her that she had very
little time to live.&nbsp; She was engaged in those duties and retrospections
which every thoughtful person finds necessary, when coming deliberately,
and with open eyes, to the boundaries of this mortal life.</p>
<p>At that time, there was a cheap edition of Byron&rsquo;s works in
contemplation, intended to bring his writings into circulation among
the masses; and the pathos arising from the story of his domestic misfortunes
was one great means relied on for giving it currency.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, some of Lady Byron&rsquo;s friends had
proposed the question to her, <i>whether she had not a responsibility
to society for the truth</i>; whether <i>she did right</i> to allow
these writings to gain influence over the popular mind by giving a silent
consent to what she knew to be utter falsehoods.</p>
<p>Lady Byron&rsquo;s whole life had been passed in the most heroic
self-abnegation and self-sacrifice: and she had now to consider whether
one more act of self-denial was not required of her before leaving this
world; namely, to declare the absolute truth, no matter at what expense
to her own feelings.</p>
<p>For this reason, it was her desire to recount the whole history to
a person of another country, and entirely out of the sphere of personal
and local feelings which might be supposed to influence those in the
country and station in life where the events really happened, in order
that she might be helped by such a person&rsquo;s views in making up
an opinion as to her own duty.</p>
<p>The interview had almost the solemnity of a death-bed avowal.&nbsp;
Lady Byron stated the facts which have been embodied in this article,
and gave to the writer a paper containing a brief memorandum of the
whole, with the dates affixed.</p>
<p>We have already spoken of that singular sense of the reality of the
spiritual world which seemed to encompass Lady Byron during the last
part of her life, and which made her words and actions seem more like
those of a blessed being detached from earth than of an ordinary mortal.&nbsp;
All her modes of looking at things, all her motives of action, all her
involuntary exhibitions of emotion, were so high above any common level,
and so entirely regulated by the most unworldly causes, that it would
seem difficult to make the ordinary world understand exactly how the
thing seemed to lie before her mind.&nbsp; What impressed the writer
more strongly than anything else was Lady Byron&rsquo;s perfect conviction
that her husband was now a redeemed spirit; that he looked back with
pain and shame and regret on all that was unworthy in his past life;
and that, if he could speak or could act in the case, he would desire
to prevent the further circulation of base falsehoods, and of seductive
poetry, which had been made the vehicle of morbid and unworthy passions.</p>
<p>Lady Byron&rsquo;s experience had led her to apply the powers of
her strong philosophical mind to the study of mental pathology: and
she had become satisfied that the solution of the painful problem which
first occurred to her as a young wife, was, after all, the true one;
namely, that Lord Byron had been one of those unfortunately constituted
persons in whom the balance of nature is so critically hung, that it
is always in danger of dipping towards insanity; and that, in certain
periods of his life, he was so far under the influence of mental disorder
as not to be fully responsible for his actions.</p>
<p>She went over with a brief and clear analysis the history of his
whole life as she had thought it out during the lonely musings of her
widowhood.&nbsp; She dwelt on the ancestral causes that gave him a nature
of exceptional and dangerous susceptibility.&nbsp; She went through
the mismanagements of his childhood, the history of his school-days,
the influence of the ordinary school-course of classical reading on
such a mind as his.&nbsp; She sketched boldly and clearly the internal
life of the young men of the time, as she, with her purer eyes, had
looked through it; and showed how habits, which, with less susceptible
fibre, and coarser strength of nature, were tolerable for his companions,
were deadly to him, unhinging his nervous system, and intensifying the
dangers of ancestral proclivities.&nbsp; Lady Byron expressed the feeling
too, that the Calvinistic theology, as heard in Scotland, had proved
in his case, as it often does in certain minds, a subtle poison.&nbsp;
He never could either disbelieve or become reconciled to it; and the
sore problems it proposes embittered his spirit against Christianity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The worst of it is, I<i> do believe</i>,&rsquo; he would often
say with violence, when he had been employing all his powers of reason,
wit, and ridicule upon these subjects.</p>
<p>Through all this sorrowful history was to be seen, not the care of
a slandered woman to make her story good, but the pathetic anxiety of
a mother, who treasures every particle of hope, every intimation of
good, in the son whom she cannot cease to love.&nbsp; With indescribable
resignation, she dwelt on those last hours, those words addressed to
her, never to be understood till repeated in eternity.</p>
<p>But all this she looked upon as for ever past; believing, that, with
the dropping of the earthly life, these morbid impulses and influences
ceased, and that higher nature which he often so beautifully expressed
in his poems became the triumphant one.</p>
<p>While speaking on this subject, her pale ethereal face became luminous
with a heavenly radiance; there was something so sublime in her belief
in the victory of love over evil, that faith with her seemed to have
become sight.&nbsp; She seemed so clearly to perceive the divine ideal
of the man she had loved, and for whose salvation she had been called
to suffer and labour and pray, that all memories of his past unworthiness
fell away, and were lost.</p>
<p>Her love was never the doting fondness of weak women; it was the
appreciative and discriminating love by which a higher nature recognised
god-like capabilities under all the dust and defilement of misuse and
passion: and she never doubted that the love which in her was so strong,
that no injury or insult could shake it, was yet stronger in the God
who made her capable of such a devotion, and that in him it was accompanied
by power to subdue all things to itself.</p>
<p>The writer was so impressed and excited by the whole scene and recital,
that she begged for two or three days to deliberate before forming any
opinion.&nbsp; She took the memorandum with her, returned to London,
and gave a day or two to the consideration of the subject.&nbsp; The
decision which she made was chiefly influenced by her reverence and
affection for Lady Byron.&nbsp; She seemed so frail, she had suffered
so much, she stood at such a height above the comprehension of the coarse
and common world, that the author had a feeling that it would almost
be like violating a shrine to ask her to come forth from the sanctuary
of a silence where she had so long abode, and plead her cause.&nbsp;
She wrote to Lady Byron, that while this act of justice did seem to
be called for, and to be in some respects most desirable, yet, as it
would involve so much that was painful to her, the writer considered
that Lady Byron would be entirely justifiable in leaving the truth to
be disclosed after her death; and recommended that all the facts necessary
should be put in the hands of some person, to be so published.</p>
<p>Years passed on.&nbsp; Lady Byron lingered four years after this
interview, to the wonder of her physicians and all her friends.</p>
<p>After Lady Byron&rsquo;s death, the writer looked anxiously, hoping
to see a Memoir of the person whom she considered the most remarkable
woman that England has produced in the century.&nbsp; No such Memoir
has appeared on the part of her friends; and the mistress of Lord Byron
has the ear of the public, and is sowing far and wide unworthy slanders,
which are eagerly gathered up and read by an undiscriminating community.</p>
<p>There may be family reasons in England which prevent Lady Byron&rsquo;s
friends from speaking.&nbsp; But Lady Byron has an American name and
an American existence; and reverence for pure womanhood is, we think,
a national characteristic of the American; and, so far as this country
is concerned, we feel that the public should have this refutation of
the slanders of the Countess Guiccioli&rsquo;s book.</p>
<h3>LORD LINDSAY&rsquo;S LETTER TO THE LONDON &lsquo;TIMES.&rsquo;<br />
TO THE EDITOR OF &lsquo;THE TIMES.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>SIR,&mdash;I have waited in expectation of a categorical denial of
the horrible charge brought by Mrs. Beecher Stowe against Lord Byron
and his sister on the alleged authority of the late Lady Byron.&nbsp;
Such denial has been only indirectly given by the letter of Messrs.
Wharton and Fords in your impression of yesterday.&nbsp; That letter
is sufficient to prove that Lady Byron never contemplated the use made
of her name, and that her descendants and representatives disclaim any
countenance of Mrs. B. Stowe&rsquo;s article; but it does not specifically
meet Mrs. Stowe&rsquo;s allegation, that Lady Byron, in conversing with
her thirteen years ago, affirmed the charge now before us.&nbsp; It
remains open, therefore, to a scandal-loving world, to credit the calumny
through the advantage of this flaw, involuntary, I believe, in the answer
produced against it.&nbsp; My object in addressing you is to supply
that deficiency by proving that what is now stated on Lady Byron&rsquo;s
supposed authority is at variance, in all respects, with what she stated
immediately after the separation, when everything was fresh in her memory
in relation to the time during which, according to Mrs. B. Stowe, she
believed that Byron and his sister were living together in guilt.&nbsp;
I publish this evidence with reluctance, but in obedience to that higher
obligation of justice to the voiceless and defenceless dead which bids
me break through a reserve that otherwise I should have held sacred.&nbsp;
The Lady Byron of 1818 would, I am certain, have sanctioned my doing
so, had she foreseen the present unparalleled occasion, and the bar
that the conditions of her will present (as I infer from Messrs Wharton
and Fords&rsquo; letter) against any fuller communication.&nbsp; Calumnies
such as the present sink deep and with rapidity into the public mind,
and are not easily eradicated.&nbsp; The fame of one of our greatest
poets, and that of the kindest and truest and most constant friend that
Byron ever had, is at stake; and it will not do to wait for revelations
from the fountain-head, which are not promised, and possibly may never
reach us.</p>
<p>The late Lady Anne Barnard, who died in 1825, a contemporary and
friend of Burke, Windham, Dundas, and a host of the wise and good of
that generation, and remembered in letters as the authoress of &lsquo;Auld
Robin Gray,&rsquo; had known the late Lady Byron from infancy, and took
a warm interest in her; holding Lord Byron in corresponding repugnance,
not to say prejudice, in consequence of what she believed to be his
harsh and cruel treatment of her young friend.&nbsp; I transcribe the
following passages, and a letter from Lady Byron herself (written in
1818) from <i>ricordi</i>, or private family memoirs, in Lady Anne&rsquo;s
autograph, now before me.&nbsp; I include the letter, because, although
treating only in general terms of the matter and causes of the separation,
it affords collateral evidence bearing strictly upon the point of the
credibility of the charge now in question:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The separation of Lord and Lady Byron astonished the world,
which believed him a reformed man as to his habits, and a becalmed man
as to his remorses.&nbsp; He had written nothing that appeared after
his marriage till the famous &ldquo;Fare thee well,&rdquo; which had
the power of compelling those to pity the writer who were not well aware
that he was not the unhappy person he affected to be.&nbsp; Lady Byron&rsquo;s
misery was whispered soon after her marriage and his ill usage, but
no word transpired, no sign escaped, from her.&nbsp; She gave birth,
shortly, to a daughter; and when she went, as soon as she was recovered,
on a visit to her father&rsquo;s, taking her little Ada with her, no
one knew that it was to return to her lord no more.&nbsp; At that period,
a severe fit of illness had confined me to bed for two months.&nbsp;
I heard of Lady Byron&rsquo;s distress; of the pains he took to give
a harsh impression of her character to the world.&nbsp; I wrote to her,
and entreated her to come and let me see and hear her, if she conceived
my sympathy or counsel could be any comfort to her.&nbsp; She came;
but what a tale was unfolded by this interesting young creature, who
had so fondly hoped to have made a young man of genius and romance (as
she supposed) happy!&nbsp; They had not been an hour in the carriage
which conveyed them from the church, when, breaking into a malignant
sneer, &ldquo;Oh! what a dupe you have been to your imagination!&nbsp;
How is it possible a woman of your sense could form the wild hope of
reforming <i>me</i>?&nbsp; Many are the tears you will have to shed
ere that plan is accomplished.&nbsp; It is enough for me that you are
my wife for me to hate you!&nbsp; If you were the wife of any other
man, I own you might have charms,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; I who listened was
astonished.&nbsp; &ldquo;How could you go on after this,&rdquo; said
I, &ldquo;my dear?&nbsp; Why did you not return to your father&rsquo;s?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because I had not a conception he was in earnest; because I reckoned
it a bad jest, and told him so,&mdash;that my opinions of him were very
different from his of himself, otherwise he would not find me by his
side.&nbsp; He laughed it over when he saw me appear hurt: and I forgot
what had passed, till forced to remember it.&nbsp; I believe he was
pleased with me, too, for a little while.&nbsp; I suppose it had escaped
his memory that I was his wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; But she described the happiness
they enjoyed to have been unequal and perturbed.&nbsp; Her situation,
in a short time, might have entitled her to some tenderness; but she
made no claim on him for any.&nbsp; He sometimes reproached her for
the motives that had induced her to marry him: all was &ldquo;vanity,
the vanity of Miss Milbanke carrying the point of reforming Lord Byron!&nbsp;
He always knew <i>her</i> inducements; her pride shut her eyes to <i>his</i>:
<i>he</i> wished to build up his character and his fortunes; both were
somewhat deranged: she had a high name, and would have a fortune worth
his attention,&mdash;let her look to that for <i>his</i> motives!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;O
Byron, Byron!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how you desolate me!&rdquo;&nbsp;
He would then accuse himself of being mad, and throw himself on the
ground in a frenzy, which she believed was affected to conceal the coldness
and malignity of his heart,&mdash;an affectation which at that time
never failed to meet with the tenderest commiseration.&nbsp; I could
find by some implications, not followed up by me, lest she might have
condemned herself afterwards for her involuntary disclosures, that he
soon attempted to corrupt her principles, both with respect to her own
conduct and her latitude for his.&nbsp; She saw the precipice on which
she stood, and kept his sister with her as much as possible.&nbsp; He
returned in the evenings from the haunts of vice, where he made her
understand he had been, with manners so profligate!&nbsp; &ldquo;O the
wretch!&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;And had he no moments of remorse?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sometimes he appeared to have them.&nbsp; One night, coming home
from one of his lawless parties, he saw me so indignantly collected,
and bearing all with such a determined calmness, that a rush of remorse
seemed to come over him.&nbsp; He called himself a monster, though his
sister was present, and threw himself in agony at my feet.&nbsp; I could
not&mdash;no&mdash;I could not forgive him such injuries.&nbsp; He had
lost me for ever!&nbsp; Astonished at the return of virtue, my tears,
I believe, flowed over his face, and I said, &lsquo;Byron, all is forgotten:
never, never shall you hear of it more!&rsquo;&nbsp; He started up,
and, folding his arms while he looked at me, burst into laughter.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Only a philosophical
experiment; that&rsquo;s all,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wished
to ascertain the value of your resolutions.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; I need
not say more of this prince of duplicity, except that varied were his
methods of rendering her wretched, even to the last.&nbsp; When her
lovely little child was born, and it was laid beside its mother on the
bed, and he was informed he might see his daughter, after gazing at
it with an exulting smile, this was the ejaculation that broke from
him: &ldquo;Oh, what an implement of torture have I acquired in you!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Such he rendered it by his eyes and manner, keeping her in a perpetual
alarm for its safety when in his presence.&nbsp; All this reads madder
than I believe he was: but she had not then made up her mind to disbelieve
his pretended insanity, and conceived it best to intrust her secret
with the excellent Dr. Baillie; telling him all that seemed to regard
the state of her husband&rsquo;s mind, and letting his advice regulate
her conduct.&nbsp; Baillie doubted of his derangement; but, as he did
not reckon his own opinion infallible, he wished her to take precautions
as if her husband were so.&nbsp; He recommended her going to the country,
but to give him no suspicion of her intentions of remaining there, and,
for a short time, to show no coldness in her letters, till she could
better ascertain his state.&nbsp; She went, regretting, as she told
me, to wear any semblance but the truth.&nbsp; A short time disclosed
the story to the world.&nbsp; He acted the part of a man driven to despair
by her inflexible resentment and by the arts of a governess (once a
servant in the family) who hated him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will give you,&rdquo;
proceeds Lady Anne, &ldquo;a few paragraphs transcribed from one of
Lady Byron&rsquo;s own letters to me.&nbsp; It is sorrowful to think,
that, in a very little time, this young and amiable creature, wise,
patient, and feeling, will have her character mistaken by every one
who reads Byron&rsquo;s works.&nbsp; To rescue her from this, I preserved
her letters; and, when she afterwards expressed a fear that any thing
of her writings should ever fall into hands to injure him (I suppose
she meant by publication), I safely assured her that it never should.&nbsp;
But here this letter shall be placed, a sacred record in her favour,
unknown to herself:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I am a very incompetent judge of the impression which
the last canto of &lsquo;Childe Harold&rsquo; may produce on the minds
of indifferent readers.&nbsp; It contains the usual trace of a conscience
restlessly awake; though his object has been too long to aggravate its
burden, as if it could thus be oppressed into eternal stupor.&nbsp;
I will hope, as you do, that it survives for his ultimate good.&nbsp;
It was the acuteness of his remorse, impenitent in its character, which
so long seemed to demand from my compassion to spare every resemblance
of reproach, every look of grief, which might have said to his conscience,
&lsquo;You have made me wretched.&rsquo;&nbsp; I am decidedly of opinion
that he <i>is</i> responsible.&nbsp; He has wished to be thought partially
deranged, or on the brink of it, to perplex observers, and prevent them
from tracing effects to their real causes through all the intricacies
of his conduct.&nbsp; I was, as I told you, at one time the dupe of
his acted insanity, and clung to the former delusions in regard to the
motives that concerned me personally, till the whole system was laid
bare.&nbsp; He is the absolute monarch of words, and uses them, as Bonaparte
did lives, for conquest, without more regard to their intrinsic value;
considering them only as ciphers, which must derive all their import
from the situation in which he places them, and the ends to which he
adapts them with such consummate skill.&nbsp; Why, then, you will say,
does he not employ them to give a better colour to his own character?&nbsp;
Because he is too good an actor to over-act, or to assume a moral garb
which it would be easy to strip off.&nbsp; In regard to his poetry,
egotism is the vital principle of his imagination, which it is difficult
for him to kindle on any subject with which his own character and interests
are not identified: but by the introduction of fictitious incidents,
by change of scene or time, he has enveloped his poetical disclosures
in a system impenetrable except to a very few; and his constant desire
of creating a sensation makes him not averse to be the object of wonder
and curiosity, even though accompanied by some dark and vague suspicions.&nbsp;
Nothing has contributed more to the misunderstanding of his real character
than the lonely grandeur in which he shrouds it, and his affectation
of being above mankind, when he exists almost in their voice.&nbsp;
The romance of his sentiments is another feature of this mask of state.&nbsp;
I know no one more habitually destitute of that enthusiasm he so beautifully
expresses, and to which he can work up his fancy chiefly by contagion.&nbsp;
I had heard he was the best of brothers, the most generous of friends;
and I thought such feelings only required to be warmed and cherished
into more diffusive benevolence.&nbsp; Though these opinions are eradicated,
and could never return but with the decay of my memory, you will not
wonder if there are still moments when the association of feelings which
arose from them soften and sadden my thoughts.&nbsp; But I have not
thanked you, dearest Lady Anne, for your kindness in regard to a principal
object,&mdash;that of rectifying false impressions.&nbsp; I trust you
understand my wishes, which never were to injure Lord Byron in any way:
for, though he would not suffer me to remain his wife, he cannot prevent
me from continuing his friend; and it was from considering myself as
such that I silenced the accusations by which my own conduct might have
been more fully justified.&nbsp; It is not necessary to speak ill of
his heart in general: it is sufficient that to me it was hard and impenetrable;
that my own must have been broken before his could have been touched.&nbsp;
I would rather represent this as <i>my</i> misfortune than as <i>his</i>
guilt; but surely that misfortune is not to be made my crime!&nbsp;
Such are my feelings: you will judge how to act.&nbsp; His allusions
to me in &lsquo;Childe Harold&rsquo; are cruel and cold, but with such
a semblance as to make <i>me</i> appear so, and to attract all sympathy
to himself.&nbsp; It is said in this poem that hatred of him will be
taught as a lesson to his child.&nbsp; I might appeal to all who have
ever heard me speak of him, and still more to my own heart, to witness
that there has been no moment when I have remembered injury otherwise
than affectionately and sorrowfully.&nbsp; It is not my duty to give
way to hopeless and wholly unrequited affection; but, so long as I live,
my chief struggle will probably be not to remember him too kindly.&nbsp;
I do not seek the sympathy of the world; but I wish to be known by those
whose opinion is valuable, and whose kindness is clear to me.&nbsp;
Among such, my dear Lady Anne, you will ever be remembered by your truly
affectionate,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;&ldquo;A.
BYRON.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is the province of your readers, and of the world at large, to
judge between the two testimonies now before them,&mdash;Lady Byron&rsquo;s
in 1816 and 1818, and that put forward in 1869 by Mrs. B. Stowe, as
communicated by Lady Byron thirteen years ago.&nbsp; In the face of
the evidence now given, positive, negative, and circumstantial, there
can be but two alternatives in the case: either Mrs. B. Stowe must have
entirely misunderstood Lady Byron, and been thus led into error and
misstatement; or we must conclude that, under the pressure of a lifelong
and secret sorrow, Lady Byron&rsquo;s mind had become clouded with an
hallucination in respect of the particular point in question.</p>
<p>The reader will admire the noble but severe character displayed in
Lady Byron&rsquo;s letter; but those who keep in view what her first
impressions were, as above recorded, may probably place a more lenient
interpretation than hers upon some of the incidents alleged to Byron&rsquo;s
discredit.&nbsp; I shall conclude with some remarks upon his character,
written shortly after his death by a wise, virtuous, and charitable
judge, the late Sir Walter Scott, likewise in a letter to Lady Anne
Barnard:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fletcher&rsquo;s account of poor Byron is extremely interesting.&nbsp;
I had always a strong attachment to that unfortunate though most richly-gifted
man, because I thought I saw that his virtues (and he had many) were
his own; and his eccentricities the result of an irritable temperament,
which sometimes approached nearly to mental disease.&nbsp; Those who
are gifted with strong nerves, a regular temper, and habitual self-command,
are not, perhaps, aware how much of what they may think virtue they
owe to constitution; and such are but too severe judges of men like
Byron, whose mind, like a day of alternate storm and sunshine, is all
dark shades and stray gleams of light, instead of the twilight gray
which illuminates happier though less distinguished mortals.&nbsp; I
always thought, that, when a moral proposition was placed plainly before
Lord Byron, his mind yielded a pleased and willing assent to it; but,
if there was any side view given in the way of raillery or otherwise,
he was willing enough to evade conviction . . . .&nbsp; It augurs ill
for the cause of Greece that this master-spirit should have been withdrawn
from their assistance just as he was obtaining a complete ascendancy
over their counsels.&nbsp; I have seen several letters from the Ionian
Islands, all of which unite in speaking in the highest praise of the
wisdom and temperance of his counsels, and the ascendancy he was obtaining
over the turbulent and ferocious chiefs of the insurgents.&nbsp; I have
some verses written by him on his last birthday: they breathe a spirit
of affection towards his wife, and a desire of dying in battle, which
seems like an anticipation of his approaching fate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
remain, sir, your obedient servant,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LINDSAY.</p>
<p>DUNECHT, Sept. 3.</p>
<h3>DR. FORBES WINSLOW&rsquo;S LETTER TO THE LONDON &lsquo;TIMES.&rsquo;</h3>
<p>TO THE EDITOR.</p>
<p>SIR,&mdash;Your paper of the 4th of September, containing an able
and deeply interesting &lsquo;Vindication of Lord Byron,&rsquo; has
followed me to this place.&nbsp; With the general details of the &lsquo;True
Story&rsquo; (as it is termed) of Lady Byron&rsquo;s separation from
her husband, as recorded in &lsquo;Macmillan&rsquo;s Magazine,&rsquo;
I have no desire or intention to grapple.&nbsp; It is only with the
hypothesis of insanity, as suggested by the clever writer of the &lsquo;Vindication&rsquo;
to account for Lady Byron&rsquo;s sad revelations to Mrs. Beecher Stowe,
with which I propose to deal.&nbsp; I do not believe that the mooted
theory of mental aberration can, in this case, be for a moment maintained.&nbsp;
If Lady Byron&rsquo;s statement of facts to Mrs. B. Stowe is to be viewed
as the creation of a distempered fancy, a delusion or hallucination
of an insane mind, what part of the narrative are we to draw the boundary-line
between fact and delusion, sanity and insanity?&nbsp; Where are we to
fix the <i>point d&rsquo;appui</i> of the lunacy?&nbsp; Again: is the
alleged &lsquo;hallucination&rsquo; to be considered as strictly confined
to the idea that Lord Byron had committed the frightful sin of incest?
or is the whole of the &lsquo;True Story&rsquo; of her married life,
as reproduced with such terrible minuteness by Mrs. Beecher Stowe, to
be viewed as the delusion of a disordered fancy?&nbsp; If Lady Byron
was the subject of an &lsquo;hallucination&rsquo; with regard to her
husband, I think it not unreasonable to conclude that the mental alienation
existed on the day of her marriage.&nbsp; If this proposition be accepted,
the natural inference will be, that the details of the conversation
which Lady Byron represents to have occurred between herself and Lord
Byron as soon as they entered the carriage never took place.&nbsp; Lord
Byron is said to have remarked to Lady Byron, &lsquo;You might have
prevented this (or words to this effect): you will now find that you
have married a devil.&nbsp; Is this alleged conversation to be viewed
as <i>fact</i>, or <i>fiction</i>? evidence of <i>sanity</i>, or <i>insanity</i>?&nbsp;
Is the revelation which Lord Byron is said to have made to his wife
of his &lsquo;incestuous passion&rsquo; another delusion, having no
foundation except in his wife&rsquo;s disordered imagination?&nbsp;
Are his alleged attempts to justify to Lady Byron&rsquo;s mind the <i>morale</i>
of the plea of &lsquo;Continental latitude&mdash;the good-humoured marriage,
in which complaisant couples mutually agree to form the cloak for each
other&rsquo;s infidelities,&rsquo;&mdash;another morbid perversion of
her imagination?&nbsp; Did this conversation ever take place?&nbsp;
It will be difficult to separate one part of the &lsquo;True Story&rsquo;
from another, and maintain that this portion indicates insanity, and
that portion represents sanity.&nbsp; If we accept the hypothesis of
hallucination, we are bound to view the whole of Lady Byron&rsquo;s
conversations with Mrs. B. Stowe, and the written statement laid before
her, as the wild and incoherent representations of a lunatic.&nbsp;
On the day when Lady Byron parted from her husband, did she enter his
private room, and find him with the &lsquo;object of his guilty passion?&rsquo;
and did he say, as they parted, &lsquo;When shall we three meet again?&rsquo;&nbsp;
Is this to be considered as an actual occurrence, or as another form
of hallucination?&nbsp; It is quite inconsistent with the theory of
Lady Byron&rsquo;s insanity to imagine that her delusion was restricted
to the idea of his having committed &lsquo;incest.&rsquo;&nbsp; In common
fairness, we are bound to view the aggregate mental phenomena which
she exhibited from the day of the marriage to their final separation
and her death.&nbsp; No person practically acquainted with the true
characteristics of insanity would affirm, that, had this idea of &lsquo;incest&rsquo;
been an insane hallucination, Lady Byron could, from the lengthened
period which intervened between her unhappy marriage and death, have
refrained from exhibiting her mental alienation, not only to her legal
advisers and trustees, but to others, exacting no pledge of secrecy
from them as to her disordered impressions.&nbsp; Lunatics do for a
time, and for some special purpose, most cunningly conceal their delusions;
but they have not the capacity to struggle for thirty-six years with
a frightful hallucination, similar to the one Lady Byron is alleged
to have had, without the insane state of mind becoming obvious to those
with whom they are daily associating.&nbsp; Neither is it consistent
with experience to suppose that, if Lady Byron had been a monomaniac,
her state of disordered understanding would have been restricted to
one hallucination.&nbsp; Her diseased brain, affecting the normal action
of thought, would, in all probability, have manifested other symptoms
besides those referred to of aberration of intellect.</p>
<p>During the last thirty years, I have not met with a case of insanity
(assuming the hypothesis of hallucination) at all parallel with that
of Lady Byron&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In my experience, it is unique.&nbsp; I
never saw a patient with such a delusion.&nbsp; If it should be established,
by the statements of those who are the depositors of the secret (and
they are now bound, in vindication of Lord Byron&rsquo;s memory, to
deny, if they have the power of doing so, this most frightful accusation),
that the idea of incest did unhappily cross Lady Byron&rsquo;s mind
prior to her finally leaving him, it no doubt arose from a most inaccurate
knowledge of facts and perfectly unjustifiable data, and was not, in
the right psychological acceptation of the phrase, an insane hallucination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir,
I remain your obedient servant,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FORBES

<p>ZARINGERHOF, FREIBURG-EN-BREISGAU, Sept. 8, 1869.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-----</p>
<h3>EXTRACT FROM LORD BYRON&rsquo;S EXPUNGED LETTER.</h3>
<p>TO MR. MURRAY.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;BOLOGNA,
June 7, 1819.</p>
<p>. . . &lsquo;Before I left Venice, I had returned to you your late,
and Mr. Hobhouse&rsquo;s sheets of &ldquo;Juan.&rdquo;&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
wait for further answers from me, but address yours to Venice as usual.&nbsp;
I know nothing of my own movements.&nbsp; I may return there in a few
days, or not for some time; all this depends on circumstances.&nbsp;
I left Mr. Hoppner very well.&nbsp; My daughter Allegra is well too,
and is growing pretty: her hair is growing darker, and her eyes are
blue.&nbsp; Her temper and her ways, Mr. Hoppner says, are like mine,
as well as her features: she will make, in that case, a manageable young
lady.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have never seen anything of Ada, the little Electra of my
Mycenae . . . .&nbsp; But there will come a day of reckoning, even if
I should not live to see it.&nbsp; I have at least seen ---- shivered,
who was one of my assassins.&nbsp; When that man was doing his worst
to uproot my whole family,&mdash;tree, branch, and blossoms; when, after
taking my retainer, he went over to them; when he was bringing desolation
on my hearth, and destruction on my household gods,&mdash;did he think
that, in less than three years, a natural event, a severe domestic,
but an expected and common calamity, would lay his carcass in a cross-road,
or stamp his name in a verdict of lunacy?&nbsp; Did he (who in his sexagenary
. . .) reflect or consider what my feelings must have been when wife
and child and sister, and name and fame and country, were to be my sacrifice
on his legal altar?&mdash;and this at a moment when my health was declining,
my fortune embarrassed, and my mind had been shaken by many kinds of
disappointment? while I was yet young, and might have reformed what
might be wrong in my conduct, and retrieved what was perplexing in my
affairs?&nbsp; But he is in his grave, and&mdash;What a long letter
I have scribbled!&rsquo; . . .</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>In order that the reader may measure the change of moral tone with
regard to Lord Byron, wrought by the constant efforts of himself and
his party, we give the two following extracts from &lsquo;Blackwood:&rsquo;</p>
<p>The first is &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; in 1819, just after the publication
of &lsquo;Don Juan:&rsquo; the second is &lsquo;Blackwood&rsquo; in
1825.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the composition of this work, there is, unquestionably,
a more thorough and intense infusion of genius and vice, power and profligacy,
than in any poem which had ever before been written in the English,
or, indeed, in any other modern language.&nbsp; Had the wickedness been
less inextricably mingled with the beauty and the grace and the strength
of a most inimitable and incomprehensible Muse, our task would have
been easy.&nbsp; &lsquo;Don Juan&rsquo; is by far the most admirable
specimen of the mixture of ease, strength, gaiety, and seriousness,
extant in the whole body of English poetry: the author has devoted his
powers to the worst of purposes and passions; and it increases his guilt
and our sorrow that he has devoted them entire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The moral strain of the whole poem is pitched in the lowest
key.&nbsp; Love, honour, patriotism, religion, are mentioned only to
be scoffed at, as if their sole resting-place were, or ought to be,
in the bosoms of fools.&nbsp; It appears, in short, as if this miserable
man, having exhausted every species of sensual gratification, having
drained the cup of sin even to its bitterest dregs, were resolved to
show us that he is no longer a human being, even in his frailties, but
a cool, unconcerned fiend, laughing with a detestable glee over the
whole of the better and worse elements of which human life is composed;
treating well-nigh with equal derision the most pure of virtues, and
the most odious of vices; dead alike to the beauty of the one, and the
deformity of the other; a mere heartless despiser of that frail but
noble humanity, whose type was never exhibited in a shape of more deplorable
degradation than in his own contemptuously distinct delineation of himself.&nbsp;
To confess to his Maker, and weep over in secret agonies the wildest
and most fantastic transgressions of heart and mind, is the part of
a conscious sinner, in whom sin has not become the sole principle of
life and action; but to lay bare to the eye of man and of <i>woman</i>
all the hidden convulsions of a wicked spirit, and to do all this without
one symptom of contrition, remorse, or hesitation, with a calm, careless
ferociousness of contented and satisfied depravity,&mdash;this was an
insult which no man of genius had ever before dared to put upon his
Creator or his species.&nbsp; Impiously railing against his God, madly
and meanly disloyal to his sovereign and his country, and brutally outraging
all the best feelings of female honour, affection, and confidence, how
small a part of chivalry is that which remains to the descendant of
the Byrons!&mdash;a gloomy visor and a deadly weapon!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Those who are acquainted (and who is not?) with the main incidents
in the private life of Lord Byron, and who have not seen this production,
will scarcely believe that malignity should have carried him so far
as to make him commence a filthy and impious poem with an elaborate
satire on the character and manners of his wife, from whom, even by
his own confession, he has been separated only in consequence of his
own cruel and heartless misconduct.&nbsp; It is in vain for Lord Byron
to attempt in any way to justify his own behaviour in that affair; and,
now that he has so openly and audaciously invited inquiry and reproach,
we do not see any good reason why he should not be plainly told so by
the general voice of his countrymen.&nbsp; It would not be an easy matter
to persuade any man who has any knowledge of the nature of woman, that
a female such as Lord Byron has himself described his wife to be would
rashly or hastily or lightly separate herself from the love with which
she had once been inspired for such a man as he is or was.&nbsp; Had
he not heaped insult upon insult, and scorn upon scorn, had he not forced
the iron of his contempt into her very soul, there is no woman of delicacy
and virtue, as he <i>admitted</i> Lady Byron to be, who would not have
hoped all things, and suffered all things, from one, her love of whom
must have been inwoven with so many exalting elements of delicious pride,
and more delicious humility.&nbsp; To offend the love of such a woman
was wrong, but it might be forgiven; to desert her was unmanly, but
he might have returned, and wiped for ever from her eyes the tears of
her desertion: but to injure and to desert, and then to turn back and
wound her widowed privacy with unhallowed strains of cold-blooded mockery,
was brutally, fiendishly, inexpiably mean.&nbsp; For impurities there
might be some possibility of pardon, were they supposed to spring only
from the reckless buoyancy of young blood and fiery passions; for impiety
there might at least be pity, were it visible that the misery of the
impious soul equalled its darkness: but for offences such as this, which
cannot proceed either from the madness of sudden impulse or the bewildered
agonies of doubt, but which speak the wilful and determined spite of
an unrepenting, unsoftened, smiling, sarcastic, joyous sinner, there
can be neither pity nor pardon.&nbsp; Our knowledge that it is committed
by one of the most powerful intellects our island ever has produced
lends intensity a thousand-fold to the bitterness of our indignation.&nbsp;
Every high thought that was ever kindled in our breasts by the Muse
of Byron, every pure and lofty feeling that ever responded from within
us to the sweep of his majestic inspirations, every remembered moment
of admiration and enthusiasm, is up in arms against him.&nbsp; We look
back with a mixture of wrath and scorn to the delight with which we
suffered ourselves to be filled by one, who, all the while he was furnishing
us with delight, must, we cannot doubt it, have been mocking us with
a cruel mockery; less cruel only, because less peculiar, than that with
which he has now turned him from the lurking-place of his selfish and
polluted exile to pour the pitiful chalice of his contumely on the surrendered
devotion of a virgin bosom, and the holy hopes of the mother of his
child.&nbsp; It is indeed a sad and a humiliating thing to know, that
in the same year, there proceeded from the same pen two productions
in all things so different as the fourth canto of &ldquo;Childe Harold&rdquo;
and his loathsome &ldquo;Don Juan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have mentioned one, and, all will admit, the worst instance
of the private malignity which has been embodied in so many passages
of &ldquo;Don Juan;&rdquo; and we are quite sure the lofty-minded and
virtuous <i>men</i> whom Lord Byron has debased himself by insulting
will close the volume which contains their own injuries, with no feelings
save those of pity for him that has inflicted them, and for her who
partakes so largely in the same injuries.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>August</i>,
1819.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>&lsquo;BLACKWOOD,&rsquo;&mdash;<i>iterum</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We shall, like all others who say anything about Lord Byron,
begin, <i>sans apologie</i>, with his personal character.&nbsp; This
is the great object of attack, the constant theme of open vituperation
to one set, and the established mark for all the petty but deadly artillery
of sneers, shrugs, groans, to another.&nbsp; Two widely different matters,
however, are generally, we might say universally, mixed up here,&mdash;the
personal character of the man, as proved by his course of life; and
his personal character, as revealed in or guessed from his books.&nbsp;
Nothing can be more unfair than the style in which this mixture is made
use of.&nbsp; Is there a noble sentiment, a lofty thought, a sublime
conception, in the book?&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, yes!&rdquo; is the answer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But what of that?&nbsp; It is only the <i>rou&eacute;</i> Byron
that speaks!&rdquo;&nbsp; Is a kind, a generous action of the man mentioned?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; comments the sage; &ldquo;but only remember
the atrocities of &lsquo;Don Juan:&rsquo; depend on it, this, if it
be true, must have been a mere freak of caprice, or perhaps a bit of
vile hypocrisy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Salvation is thus shut out at either entrance:
the poet damns the man, and the man the poet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nobody will suspect us of being so absurd as to suppose that
it is possible for people to draw no inferences as to the character
of an author from his book, or to shut entirely out of view, in judging
of a book, that which they may happen to know about the man who writes
it.&nbsp; The cant of the day supposes such things to be practicable;
but they are not.&nbsp; But what we complain of and scorn is the extent
to which they are carried in the case of this particular individual,
as compared with others; the impudence with which things are at once
assumed to be facts in regard to <i>his</i> private history; and the
absolute unfairness of never arguing from <i>his</i> writings to <i>him,
but for evil</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take the man, in the first place, as unconnected, in so far
as we can thus consider him, with his works; and ask, What, after all,
are the bad things we know of him?&nbsp; Was he dishonest or dishonourable?
had he ever <i>done</i> anything to forfeit, or even endanger, his rank
as a gentleman?&nbsp; Most assuredly, no such accusations have ever
been maintained against Lord Byron the private nobleman, although something
of the sort may have been insinuated against the author.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
he was such a profligate in his morals, that his name cannot be mentioned
with anything like tolerance.&rdquo;&nbsp; Was he so, indeed?&nbsp;
We should like extremely to have the catechising of the individual man
who says so.&nbsp; That he indulged in sensual vices, to some extent,
is certain, and to be regretted and condemned.&nbsp; But was he worse,
as to such matters, than the enormous majority of those who join in
the cry of horror upon this occasion?&nbsp; We most assuredly believe
exactly the reverse; and we rest our belief upon very plain and intelligible
grounds.&nbsp; First, we hold it impossible that the majority of mankind,
or that anything beyond a very small minority, are or can be entitled
to talk of sensual profligacy as having formed a part of the life and
character of the man, who, dying at six and thirty, bequeathed a collection
of works such as Byron&rsquo;s to the world.&nbsp; Secondly, we hold
it impossible, that laying the extent of his intellectual labours out
of the question, and looking only to the nature of the intellect which
generated, and delighted in generating, such beautiful and noble conceptions
as are to be found in almost all Lord Byron&rsquo;s works,&mdash;we
hold it impossible that very many men can be at once capable of comprehending
these conceptions, and entitled to consider sensual profligacy as having
formed the principal, or even a principal, trait in Lord Byron&rsquo;s
character.&nbsp; Thirdly, and lastly, we have never been able to hear
any one fact established which could prove Lord Byron to deserve anything
like the degree or even kind of odium which has, in regard to matters
of this class, been heaped upon his name.&nbsp; We have no story of
base unmanly seduction, or false and villainous intrigue, against him,&mdash;none
whatever.&nbsp; It seems to us quite clear, that, if he had been at
all what is called in society an unprincipled sensualist, there must
have been many such stories, authentic and authenticated.&nbsp; But
there are none such,&mdash;absolutely none.&nbsp; His name has been
coupled with the names of three, four, or more women of some rank: but
what kind of women?&nbsp; Every one of them, in the first place, about
as old as himself in years, and therefore a great deal older in character;
every one of them utterly battered in reputation long before he came
into contact with them,&mdash;licentious, unprincipled, characterless
women.&nbsp; What father has ever reproached him with the ruin of his
daughter?&nbsp; What husband has denounced him as the destroyer of his
peace?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let us not be mistaken.&nbsp; We are not defending the offences
of which Lord Byron unquestionably was guilty; neither are we finding
fault with those, who, after looking honestly within and around themselves,
condemn those offences, no matter how severely: but we are speaking
of society in general as it now exists; and we say that there is vile
hypocrisy in the tone in which Lord Byron is talked of <i>there</i>.&nbsp;
We say, that, although all offences against purity of life are miserable
things, and condemnable things, the degrees of guilt attached to different
offences of this class are as widely different as are the degrees of
guilt between an assault and a murder; and we confess our belief, that
no man of Byron&rsquo;s station or age could have run much risk in gaining
a very bad name in society, had a course of life similar (in so far
as we know any thing of that) to Lord Byron&rsquo;s been the only thing
chargeable against him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The last poem he wrote was produced upon his birthday, not
many weeks before he died.&nbsp; We consider it as one of the finest
and most touching effusions of his noble genius.&nbsp; We think he who
reads it, and can ever after bring himself to regard even the worst
transgressions that have been charged against Lord Byron with any feelings
but those of humble sorrow and manly pity, is not deserving of the name
of man.&nbsp; The deep and passionate struggles with the inferior elements
of his nature (and ours) which it records; the lofty thirsting after
purity; the heroic devotion of a soul half weary of life, because unable
to believe in its own powers to live up to what it so intensely felt
to be, and so reverentially honoured as, the right; the whole picture
of this mighty spirit, often darkened, but never sunk,&mdash;often erring,
but never ceasing to see and to worship the beauty of virtue; the repentance
of it; the anguish; the aspiration, almost stifled in despair,&mdash;the
whole of this is such a whole, that we are sure no man can read these
solemn verses too often; and we recommend them for repetition, as the
best and most conclusive of all possible answers whenever the name of
Byron is insulted by those who permit themselves to forget nothing,
either in his life or in his writings, but the good.&rsquo;&mdash;[1825.]</p>
<h3>LETTERS OF LADY BYRON TO H. C. ROBINSON</h3>
<p>The following letters of Lady Byron&rsquo;s are reprinted from the
Memoirs of H. C. Robinson.&nbsp; They are given that the reader may
form some judgment of the strength and activity of her mind, and the
elevated class of subjects upon which it habitually dwelt.</p>
<p>LADY BYRON TO H. C. R.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;DEC.
31, 1853.</p>
<p>&lsquo;DEAR MR. CRABB ROBINSON,&mdash;I have an inclination, if I
were not afraid of trespassing on your time (but you can put my letter
by for any leisure moment), to enter upon the history of a character
which I think less appreciated than it ought to be.&nbsp; Men, I observe,
do not understand men in certain points, without a woman&rsquo;s interpretation.&nbsp;
Those points, of course, relate to feelings.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here is a man taken by most of those who come in his way either
for Dry-as-Dust, Matter-of-fact, or for a &ldquo;vain visionary.&rdquo;&nbsp;
There are, doubtless, some defective or excessive characteristics which
give rise to those impressions.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My acquaintance was made, oddly enough, with him twenty-seven
years ago.&nbsp; A pauper said to me of him, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the <i>poor
man&rsquo;s</i> doctor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such a recommendation seemed to
me a good one: and I also knew that his organizing head had formed the
first district society in England (for Mrs. Fry told me she could not
have effected it without his aid); yet he has always ignored his own
share of it.&nbsp; I felt in him at once the curious combination of
the Christian and the cynic,&mdash;of reverence for <i>man</i>, and
contempt of <i>men</i>.&nbsp; It was then an internal war, but one in
which it was evident to me that the holier cause would be victorious,
because there was deep belief, and, as far as I could learn, a blameless
and benevolent life.&nbsp; He appeared only to want sunshine.&nbsp;
It was a plant which could not be brought to perfection in darkness.&nbsp;
He had begun life by the most painful conflict between filial duty and
conscience,&mdash;a large provision in the church secured for him by
his father; but he could not <i>sign</i>.&nbsp; There was discredit,
as you know, attached to such scruples.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was also, when I first knew him, under other circumstances
of a nature to depress him, and to make him feel that he was unjustly
treated.&nbsp; The gradual removal of these called forth his better
nature in thankfulness to God.&nbsp; Still the old misanthropic modes
of expressing himself obtruded themselves at times.&nbsp; This passed
in &lsquo;48 between him and Robertson.&nbsp; Robertson said to me,
&ldquo;I want to know something about ragged schools.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
replied, &ldquo;You had better ask Dr. King: he knows more about them.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I?&rdquo;
said Dr. King.&nbsp; &ldquo;I take care to know nothing of ragged schools,
lest they should make <i>me</i> ragged.&rdquo;&nbsp; Robertson did not
see through it.&nbsp; Perhaps I had been taught to understand such suicidal
speeches by my cousin, Lord Melbourne.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The example of Christ, imperfectly as it may be understood
by him, has been ever before his eyes: he woke to the thought of following
it, and he went to rest consoled or rebuked by it.&nbsp; After nearly
thirty years of intimacy, I may, without presumption, form that opinion.&nbsp;
There is something pathetic to me in seeing any one <i>so</i> unknown.&nbsp;
Even the other medical friends of Robertson, when I knew that Dr. King
felt a woman&rsquo;s tenderness, said on one occasion to him, &ldquo;But
we know that you, Dr. King, are <i>above all feeling</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If I have made the character more consistent to you by putting
in these bits of mosaic, my pen will not have been ill employed, nor
unpleasingly to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Yours
truly,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;A.
NOEL BYRON.&rsquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>LADY BYRON TO H. C. R.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;BRIGHTON,
NOV. 15,1854.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The thoughts of all this public and private suffering have
taken the life out of my pen when I tried to write on matters which
would otherwise have been most interesting to me: <i>these</i> seemed
the shadows, <i>that</i> the stern reality.&nbsp; It is good, however,
to be drawn out of scenes in which one is absorbed most unprofitably,
and to have one&rsquo;s natural interests revived by such a letter as
I have to thank you for, as well as its predecessor.&nbsp; You touch
upon the very points which do interest me the most, habitually.&nbsp;
The change of form, and enlargement of design, in &ldquo;The Prospective&rdquo;
<i>had</i> led me to express to one of the promoters of that object
my desire to contribute.&nbsp; The religious crisis is instant; but
the man for it?&nbsp; The next best thing, if, as I believe, he is not
to be found <i>in England</i>, is an association of such men as are
to edit the new periodical.&nbsp; An address delivered by Freeman Clarke
at Boston, last May, makes me think him better fitted for a leader than
any other of the religious &ldquo;Free-thinkers.&rdquo;&nbsp; I wish
I could send you my one copy; but you do not <i>need</i>, it, and others
do.&nbsp; His object is the same as that of the &ldquo;Alliance Universelle:&rdquo;
only he is still more free from &ldquo;partialism&rdquo; (his own word)
in his aspirations and practical suggestions with respect to an ultimate
&ldquo;Christian synthesis.&rdquo;&nbsp; He so far adopts Comte&rsquo;s
theory as to speak of religion itself under three successive aspects,
historically,&mdash;1.&nbsp; Thesis;&nbsp; 2. Antithesis;&nbsp; 3. Synthesis.&nbsp;
I made his acquaintance in England; and he inspired confidence at once
by his brave independence (<i>incomptis capillis</i>) and self-<i>un</i>consciousness.&nbsp;
J. J. Tayler&rsquo;s address of last month follows in the same path,&mdash;all
in favour of the &ldquo;irenics,&rdquo; instead of polemics.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The answer which you gave me so fully and distinctly to the
questions I proposed for your consideration was of value in turning
to my view certain aspects of the case which I had not before observed.&nbsp;
I had begun a second attack on your patience, when all was forgotten
in the news of the day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>LADY BYRON TO H. C. R.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;BRIGHTON,
Dec. 25, 1854.</p>
<p>&lsquo;With J. J. Tayler, though almost a stranger to him, I have
a peculiar reason for sympathising.&nbsp; A book of his was a treasure
to my daughter on her death-bed. <a name="citation320a"></a><a href="#footnote320a">{320a}</a></p>
<p>&lsquo;I must confess to intolerance of opinion as to these two points,&mdash;<i>eternal</i>
evil in any form, and (involved in it) <i>eternal</i> suffering.&nbsp;
To believe in these would take away my God, who is all-loving.&nbsp;
With a God with whom omnipotence and omniscience were all, evil might
be eternal; but why do I say to you what has been better said elsewhere?&rsquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>LADY BYRON TO H. C. R.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;BRIGHTON,
Jan. 31, 1855.</p>
<p>. . .&nbsp; &lsquo;The great difficulty in respect to &ldquo;The
Review&rdquo; <a name="citation320b"></a><a href="#footnote320b">{320b}</a>
seems to be to settle a basis, inclusive and exclusive; in short, a
<i>boundary question</i>.&nbsp; From what you said, I think you agreed
with me, that a latitudinarian Christianity ought to be the character
of the periodical; but the depth of the roots should correspond with
the width of the branches of that tree of knowledge.&nbsp; Of some of
those minds one might say, &ldquo;They have no root;&rdquo; and then,
the richer the foliage, the more danger that the trunk will fall.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Grounded in Christ&rdquo; has to me a most practical significance
and value.&nbsp; I, too, have anxiety about a friend (Miss Carpenter)
whose life is of public importance: she, more than any of the English
reformers, unless Nash and Wright, has found the art of drawing out
the good of human nature, and proving its existence.&nbsp; She makes
these discoveries by the light of love.&nbsp; I hope she may recover,
from to-day&rsquo;s report.&nbsp; The object of a Reformatory in Leicester
has just been secured at a county meeting . . . .&nbsp; Now the desideratum
is well-qualified masters and mistresses.&nbsp; If you hear of such
by chance, pray let me know.&nbsp; The regular schoolmaster is an extinguisher.&nbsp;
Heart, and familiarity with the class to be educated, are all important.&nbsp;
At home and abroad, the evidence is conclusive on that point; for I
have for many years attended to such experiments in various parts of
Europe.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Irish Quarterly&rdquo; has taken up the subject
with rather more zeal than judgment.&nbsp; I had hoped that a sound
and temperate exposition of the facts might form an article in the &ldquo;Might-have-been
Review.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>LADY BYRON TO H. C. R.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;BRIGHTON,
Feb. 12, 1855.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have at last earned the pleasure of writing to you by having
settled troublesome matters of little moment, except locally; and I
gladly take a wider range by sympathizing in your interests.&nbsp; There
is, besides, no responsibility&mdash;for me at least&mdash;in canvassing
the merits of Russell or Palmerston, but much in deciding whether the
&ldquo;village politician&rdquo; Jackson or Thompson shall be leader
in the school or public-house.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Has not the nation been brought to a conviction that the <i>system</i>
should be broken up? and is Lord Palmerston, who has used it so long
and so cleverly, likely to promote that object?</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, whatever obstacles there may be in state affairs, that
general persuasion must modify other departments of action and knowledge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Unroasted coffee&rdquo; will no longer be accepted under the
official seal,&mdash;another reason for a new literary combination for
distinct special objects, a review in which every separate article should
be <i>convergent</i>.&nbsp; If, instead of the problem to make a circle
pass through three given points, it were required to find the centre
from which to describe a circle through any three articles in the &ldquo;Edinburgh&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Westminster Review,&rdquo; who would accomplish it?&nbsp;
Much force is lost for want of this one-mindedness amongst the contributors.&nbsp;
It would not exclude variety or freedom in the unlimited discussion
of means towards the ends unequivocally recognized.&nbsp; If St. Paul
had edited a review, he might</p>
<p>have admitted Peter as well as Luke or Barnabas . . . .</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ross gave us an excellent sermon, yesterday, on &ldquo;Hallowing
the Name.&rdquo;&nbsp; Though far from commonplace, it might have been
delivered in any church.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We have had Fanny Kemble here last week.&nbsp; I only heard
her &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rdquo;&mdash;not less instructive, as her
readings always are, than exciting; for in her glass Shakspeare is a
philosopher.&nbsp; I know her, and honour her, for her truthfulness
amidst all trials.&rsquo;</p>

<p>LADY BYRON TO H. C. R.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;BRIGHTON,
March 5, 1855.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I recollect only those passages of Dr. Kennedy&rsquo;s book
which bear upon the opinions of Lord Byron.&nbsp; Strange as it may
seem, Dr. Kennedy is most faithful where you doubt his being so.&nbsp;
Not merely from casual expressions, but from the whole tenor of Lord
Byron&rsquo;s feelings, I could not but conclude he was a believer in
the inspiration of the Bible, and had the gloomiest Calvinistic tenets.&nbsp;
To that unhappy view of the relation of the creature to the Creator,
I have always ascribed the misery of his life . . . .&nbsp; It is enough
for me to remember, that he who thinks his transgressions beyond <i>forgiveness</i>
(and such was his own deepest feeling) <i>has</i> righteousness beyond
that of the self-satisfied sinner, or, perhaps, of the half-awakened.&nbsp;
It was impossible for me to doubt, that, could he have been at once
assured of pardon, his living faith in a moral duty, and love of virtue
(&ldquo;I love the virtues which I cannot claim&rdquo;), would have
conquered every temptation.&nbsp; Judge, then, how I must hate the creed
which made him see God as an Avenger, not a Father!&nbsp; My own impressions
were just the reverse, but could have little weight; and it was in vain
to seek to turn his thoughts for long from that <i>id&eacute;e fixe</i>
with which he connected his physical peculiarity as a stamp.&nbsp; Instead
of being made happier by any apparent good, he felt convinced that every
blessing would be &ldquo;turned into a curse&rdquo; to him.&nbsp; Who,
possessed by such ideas, could lead a life of love and service to God
or man?&nbsp; They must, in a measure, realize themselves.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
worst of it is, I <i>do</i> believe,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; I, like all
connected with him, was broken against the rock of predestination.&nbsp;
I may be pardoned for referring to his frequent expression of the sentiment
that I was only sent to show him the happiness he was forbidden to enjoy.&nbsp;
You will now better understand why &ldquo;The Deformed Transformed&rdquo;
is too painful to me for discussion.&nbsp; Since writing the above,
I have read Dr. Granville&rsquo;s letter on the Emperor of Russia, some
passages of which seem applicable to the prepossession I have described.&nbsp;
I will not mix up less serious matters with these, which forty years
have not made less than present still to me.&rsquo;</p>

April 8, 1855.</p>
<p>. . . . &lsquo;The book which has interested me most, lately, is
that on &ldquo;Mosaism,&rdquo; translated by Miss Goldsmid, and which
I read, as you will believe, without any Christian (unchristian?) prejudice.&nbsp;
The missionaries of the Unity were always, from my childhood, regarded
by me as in that sense <i>the</i> people; and I believe they were true
to that mission, though blind, intellectually, in demanding the crucifixion.&nbsp;
The present aspect of Jewish opinions, as shown in that book, is all
but Christian.&nbsp; The author is under the error of taking, as the
representatives of Christianity, the Mystics, Ascetics, and Quietists;
and therefore he does not know how near he is to the true spirit of
the gospel.&nbsp; If you should happen to see Miss Goldsmid, pray tell
her what a great service I think she has rendered to us <i>soi-disant</i>
Christians in translating a book which must make us sensible of the
little we have done, and the much we have to do, to justify our preference
of the later to the earlier dispensation.&rsquo; . . .</p>

<p>&lsquo;You appear to have more definite information respecting &ldquo;The
Review&rdquo; than I have obtained . . .&nbsp; It was also said that
&ldquo;The Review&rdquo; would, in fact, be &ldquo;The Prospective&rdquo;
amplified,&mdash;not satisfactory to me, because I have always thought
that periodical too Unitarian, in the sense of separating itself from
other Christian churches, if not by a high wall, at least by a wire-gauze
fence.&nbsp; Now, separation is to me <i>the</i> &alpha;&iota;&rho;&epsilon;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;.&nbsp;
The revelation through Nature never separates: it is the revelation
through the Book which separates.&nbsp; Whewell and Brewster would have
been one, had they not, I think, equally dimmed their lamps of science
when reading their Bibles.&nbsp; As long as we think a truth <i>better</i>
for being shut up in a text, we are not of the wide-world religion,
which is to include all in one fold: for that text will not be accepted
by the followers of other books, or students of the same; and separation
will ensue.&nbsp; The Christian Scripture should be dear to us, not
as the charter of a few, but of mankind; and to fashion it into cages
is to deny its ultimate objects.&nbsp; These thoughts hot, like the
roll at breakfast, where your letter was so welcome an addition.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>THREE DOMESTIC POEMS BY LORD BYRON.</h3>
<p>FARE THEE WELL.</p>
<blockquote><p>Fare thee well! and if for ever,<br />
Still for ever fare thee well!<br />
Even though unforgiving, never<br />
&rsquo;Gainst thee shall my heart rebel.</p>
<p>Would that breast were bared before thee<br />
Where thy head so oft hath lain,<br />
While that placid sleep came o&rsquo;er thee<br />
Which thou ne&rsquo;er canst know again!</p>
<p>Would that breast, by thee glanced over,<br />
Every inmost thought could show!<br />
Then thou wouldst at last discover<br />
&rsquo;Twas not well to spurn it so.</p>
<p>Though the world for this commend thee,<br />
Though it smile upon the blow,<br />
Even its praises must offend thee,<br />
Founded on another&rsquo;s woe.</p>
<p>Though my many faults defaced me,<br />
Could no other arm be found,<br />
Than the one which once embraced me,<br />
To inflict a cureless wound?</p>
<p>Yet, oh! yet, thyself deceive not:<br />
Love may sink by slow decay;<br />
But, by sudden wrench, believe not<br />
Hearts can thus be torn away:</p>
<p>Still thine own its life retaineth;<br />
Still must mine, though bleeding, beat<br />
And the undying thought which paineth<br />
Is&mdash;that we no more may meet.</p>
<p>These are words of deeper sorrow<br />
Than the wail above the dead:<br />
Both shall live, but every morrow<br />
Wake us from a widowed bed.</p>
<p>And when thou wouldst solace gather,<br />
When our child&rsquo;s first accents flow,<br />
Wilt thou teach her to say &lsquo;Father,&rsquo;<br />
Though his care she must forego?</p>
<p>When her little hand shall press thee,<br />
When her lip to thine is pressed,<br />
Think of him whose prayer shall bless thee;<br />
Think of him thy love had blessed.</p>
<p>Should her lineaments resemble<br />
Those thou never more mayst see,<br />
Then thy heart will softly tremble<br />
With a pulse yet true to me.</p>
<p>All my faults, perchance, thou knowest;<br />
All my madness none can know:<br />
All my hopes, where&rsquo;er thou goest,<br />
Wither; yet with thee they go.</p>
<p>Every feeling hath been shaken:<br />
Pride, which not a world could bow,<br />
Bows to thee, by thee forsaken;<br />
Even my soul forsakes me now.</p>
<p>But &rsquo;tis done: all words are idle;<br />
Words from me are vainer still;<br />
But the thoughts we cannot bridle<br />
Force their way without the will.</p>
<p>Fare thee well!&mdash;thus disunited,<br />
Torn from every nearer tie,<br />
Seared in heart, and lone and blighted,<br />
More than this I scarce can die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A SKETCH.</p>
<blockquote><p>Born in the garret, in the kitchen bred;<br />
Promoted thence to deck her mistress&rsquo; head;<br />
Next&mdash;for some gracious service unexpress&rsquo;d,<br />
And from its wages only to be guessed&mdash;<br />
Raised from the toilette to the table, where<br />
Her wondering betters wait behind her chair,<br />
With eye unmoved, and forehead unabashed,<br />
She dines from off the plate she lately washed.<br />
Quick with the tale, and ready with the lie,<br />
The genial confidante and general spy,<br />
Who could, ye gods! her next employment guess?&mdash;<br />
An only infant&rsquo;s earliest governess!<br />
She taught the child to read, and taught so well,<br />
That she herself, by teaching, learned to spell.<br />
An adept next in penmanship she grows,<br />
As many a nameless slander deftly shows:<br />
What she had made the pupil of her art,<br />
None know; but that high soul secured the heart,<br />
And panted for the truth it could not hear,<br />
With longing breast and undeluded ear.<br />
Foiled was perversion by that youthful mind,<br />
Which flattery fooled not, baseness could not blind,<br />
Deceit infect not, near contagion soil,<br />
Indulgence weaken, nor example spoil,<br />
Nor mastered science tempt her to look down<br />
On humbler talents with a pitying frown,<br />
Nor genius swell, nor beauty render vain,<br />
Nor envy ruffle to retaliate pain,<br />
Nor fortune change, pride raise, nor passion bow,<br />
Nor virtue teach austerity, till now.<br />
Serenely purest of her sex that live;<br />
But wanting one sweet weakness,&mdash;to forgive;<br />
Too shocked at faults her soul can never know,<br />
She deems that all could be like her below:<br />
Foe to all vice, yet hardly Virtue&rsquo;s friend;<br />
For Virtue pardons those she would amend.</p>
<p>But to the theme, now laid aside too long,&mdash;<br />
The baleful burthen of this honest song.<br />
Though all her former functions are no more,<br />
She rules the circle which she served before.<br />
If mothers&mdash;none know why&mdash;before her quake;<br />
If daughters dread her for the mothers&rsquo; sake;<br />
If early habits&mdash;those false links, which bind<br />
At times the loftiest to the meanest mind&mdash;<br />
Have given her power too deeply to instil<br />
The angry essence of her deadly will;<br />
If like a snake she steal within your walls<br />
Till the black slime betray her as she crawls;<br />
If like a viper to the heart she wind,<br />
And leave the venom there she did not find,<br />
What marvel that this hag of hatred works<br />
Eternal evil latent as she lurks,<br />
To make a Pandemonium where she dwells,<br />
And reign the Hecate of domestic hells?<br />
Skilled by a touch to deepen scandal&rsquo;s tints<br />
With all the kind mendacity of hints,<br />
While mingling truth with falsehood, sneers with smiles,<br />
A thread of candour with a web of wiles;<br />
A plain blunt show of briefly-spoken seeming,<br />
To hide her bloodless heart&rsquo;s soul-hardened scheming;<br />
A lip of lies; a face formed to conceal,<br />
And, without feeling, mock at all who feel;<br />
With a vile mask the Gorgon would disown;<br />
A cheek of parchment, and an eye of stone.<br />
Mark how the channels of her yellow blood<br />
Ooze to her skin, and stagnate there to mud!<br />
Cased like the centipede in saffron mail,<br />
Or darker greenness of the scorpion&rsquo;s scale,<br />
(For drawn from reptiles only may we trace<br />
Congenial colours in that soul or face,)&mdash;<br />
Look on her features! and behold her mind<br />
As in a mirror of itself defined.<br />
Look on the picture! deem it not o&rsquo;ercharged;<br />
There is no trait which might not be enlarged:<br />
Yet true to &lsquo;Nature&rsquo;s journeymen,&rsquo; who made<br />
This monster when their mistress left off trade,<br />
This female dog-star of her little sky,<br />
Where all beneath her influence droop or die.</p>
<p>O wretch without a tear, without a thought,<br />
Save joy above the ruin thou hast wrought!<br />
The time shall come, nor long remote, when thou<br />
Shalt feel far more than thou inflictest now,&mdash;<br />
Feel for thy vile self-loving self in vain,<br />
And turn thee howling in unpitied pain.<br />
May the strong curse of crushed affections light<br />
Back on thy bosom with reflected blight,<br />
And make thee, in thy leprosy of mind,<br />
As loathsome to thyself as to mankind,<br />
Till all thy self-thoughts curdle into hate<br />
Black as thy will for others would create:<br />
Till thy hard heart be calcined into dust,<br />
And thy soul welter in its hideous crust!<br />
Oh, may thy grave be sleepless as the bed,<br />
The widowed couch of fire, that thou hast spread!<br />
Then, when thou fain wouldst weary Heaven with prayer,<br />
Look on thine earthly victims, and despair!<br />
Down to the dust! and, as thou rott&rsquo;st away,<br />
Even worms shall perish on thy poisonous clay.<br />
But for the love I bore, and still must bear,<br />
To her thy malice from all ties would tear,<br />
Thy name, thy human name, to every eye<br />
The climax of all scorn, should hang on high,<br />
Exalted o&rsquo;er thy less abhorred compeers,<br />
And festering in the infamy of years.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LINES ON HEARING THAT LADY BYRON WAS ILL.</p>
<blockquote><p>And thou wert sad, yet I was not with thee!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thou wert sick, and yet I was not near!<br />
Methought that joy and health alone could be<br />
Where I was not, and pain and sorrow here.<br />
And is it thus?&nbsp; It is as I foretold,<br />
And shall be more so; for the mind recoils<br />
Upon itself, and the wrecked heart lies cold,<br />
While heaviness collects the shattered spoils.<br />
It is not in the storm nor in the strife<br />
We feel benumbed, and wish to be no more,<br />
But in the after-silence on the shore,<br />
When all is lost except a little life.<br />
I am too well avenged!&nbsp; But &rsquo;twas my right:<br />
Whate&rsquo;er my sins might be, thou wert not sent<br />
To be the Nemesis who should requite;<br />
Nor did Heaven choose so near an instrument.<br />
Mercy is for the merciful!&mdash;if thou<br />
Hast been of such, &rsquo;twill be accorded now.<br />
Thy nights are banished from the realms of sleep!<br />
Yes! they may flatter thee; but thou shalt feel<br />
A hollow agony which will not heal;<br />
For thou art pillowed on a curse too deep:<br />
Thou hast sown in my sorrow, and must reap<br />
The bitter harvest in a woe as real!<br />
I have had many foes, but none like thee;<br />
For &rsquo;gainst the rest myself I could defend,<br />
And be avenged, or turn them into friend;<br />
But thou in safe implacability<br />
Hadst nought to dread, in thy own weakness shielded;<br />
And in my love, which hath but too much yielded,<br />
And spared, for thy sake, some I should not spare.<br />
And thus upon the world,&mdash;trust in thy truth,<br />
And the wild fame of my ungoverned youth,<br />
On things that were not and on things that are,&mdash;<br />
Even upon such a basis hast thou built<br />
A monument, whose cement hath been guilt;<br />
The moral Clytemnestra of thy lord,<br />
And hewed down, with an unsuspected sword,<br />
Fame, peace, and hope, and all the better life,<br />
Which, but for this cold treason of thy heart,<br />
Might still have risen from out the grave of strife,<br />
And found a nobler duty than to part.<br />
But of thy virtues didst thou make a vice,<br />
Trafficking with them in a purpose cold,<br />
For present anger and for future gold,<br />
And buying others&rsquo; grief at any price.<br />
And thus, once entered into crooked ways,<br />
The early truth, which was thy proper praise,<br />
Did not still walk beside thee, but at times,<br />
And with a breast unknowing its own crimes,<br />
Deceit, averments incompatible,<br />
Equivocations, and the thoughts which dwell<br />
In Janus-spirits; the significant eye<br />
Which learns to lie with silence; the pretext<br />
Of prudence, with advantages annexed;<br />
The acquiescence in all things which tend,<br />
No matter how, to the desired end,&mdash;<br />
All found a place in thy philosophy.<br />
The means were worthy, and the end is won:<br />
I would not do by thee as thou hast done!</p>

himself, I know not.&rsquo;&nbsp; A note says that Murray had been much
shocked by Byron&rsquo;s misstatements to Medwin as to money-matters
with him.&nbsp; The note goes on to say, &lsquo;Medwin could not have

presumption is that Byron mystified his gallant acquaintance.&nbsp;

<p><a name="footnote161"></a><a href="#citation161">{161}</a> This novel
of Godwin&rsquo;s is a remarkably powerful story.&nbsp; It is related
in the first person by the supposed hero, Caleb Williams.&nbsp; He represents
himself as private secretary to a gentleman of high family named Falkland.&nbsp;
Caleb accidentally discovers that his patron has, in a moment of passion,
committed a murder.&nbsp; Falkland confesses the crime to Caleb, and
tells him that henceforth he shall always suspect him, and keep watch
over him.&nbsp; Caleb finds this watchfulness insupportable, and tries
to escape, but without success.&nbsp; He writes a touching letter to
his patron, imploring him to let him go, and promising never to betray
him.&nbsp; The scene where Falkland refuses this is the most highly
wrought in the book.&nbsp; He says to him, &ldquo;Do not imagine that
I am afraid of you; I wear an armour against which all your weapons
are impotent.&nbsp; I have dug a pit for you: and whichever way you
move, backward or forward, to the right or the left, it is ready to
swallow you.&nbsp; Be still!&nbsp; If once you fall, call as loud as
you will, no man on earth shall hear your cries: prepare a tale however

I laugh at so feeble a defence.&nbsp; It is I that say it: you may believe

stamping on the ground with fury, &ldquo;that I have sworn to preserve
my reputation, whatever be the expense; that I love it more than the
whole world and its inhabitants taken together? and do you think that
you shall wound it?&rdquo;&nbsp; The rest of the book shows how this
threat was executed.</p>

Mackenzie, in a note to the &lsquo;Noctes&rsquo; of July 1822, gives
the following saying of Maginn, one of the principal lights of the club:
&lsquo;No man, however much he might tend to civilisation, was to be
regarded as having absolutely reached its apex until he was drunk.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He also records it as a further joke of the club, that a man&rsquo;s
having reached this apex was to be tested by his inability to pronounce
the word &lsquo;civilisation,&rsquo; which, he says, after ten o&rsquo;clock
at night ought to be abridged to <i>civilation</i>, &lsquo;by syncope,
or vigorously speaking by hic-cup.&rsquo;</p>

little incident shows the characteristic carefulness and accuracy of
Lady Byron&rsquo;s habits.&nbsp; This statement was written fourteen
years after the events spoken of; but Lady Byron carefully quotes a
passage from her mother&rsquo;s letter written at that time.&nbsp; This
shows that a copy of Lady Milbanke&rsquo;s letter had been preserved,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
